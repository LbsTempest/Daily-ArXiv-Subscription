| **[Paper2Video: Automatic Video Generation from Scientific Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05096v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10 minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101 research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding, subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.</p></details> | 2025-10-06 | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AlignDiT: Multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer for Synchronized Speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20629v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the task of multimodal-to-speech generation, which aims to synthesize high-quality speech from multiple input modalities: text, video, and reference audio. This task has gained increasing attention due to its wide range of applications, such as film production, dubbing, and virtual avatars. Despite recent progress, existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech intelligibility, audio-video synchronization, speech naturalness, and voice similarity to the reference speaker. To address these challenges, we propose AlignDiT, a multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer that generates accurate, synchronized, and natural-sounding speech from aligned multimodal inputs. Built upon the in-context learning capability of the DiT architecture, AlignDiT explores three effective strategies to align multimodal representations. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal classifier-free guidance mechanism that allows the model to adaptively balance information from each modality during speech synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignDiT significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks in terms of quality, synchronization, and speaker similarity. Moreover, AlignDiT exhibits strong generalization capability across various multimodal tasks, such as video-to-speech synthesis and visual forced alignment, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance. The demo page is available at https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/projects/AlignDiT.</p></details> | 2025-10-03 | ACM Multimedia 2025 |
| **[BatonVoice: An Operationalist Framework for Enhancing Controllable Speech Synthesis with Linguistic Intelligence from LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26514v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a ``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual ``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.</p></details> | 2025-09-30 |  |
| **[HiStyle: Hierarchical Style Embedding Predictor for Text-Prompt-Guided Controllable Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25842v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern: embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces. Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility. Audio samples are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/HiStyle-2517/.</p></details> | 2025-09-30 |  |
| **[LTA-L2S: Lexical Tone-Aware Lip-to-Speech Synthesis for Mandarin with Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25670v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lip-to-speech (L2S) synthesis for Mandarin is a significant challenge, hindered by complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the critical role of lexical tones in intelligibility. To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0 contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units, which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.</p></details> | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[MGM-Omni: Scaling Omni LLMs to Personalized Long-Horizon Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25131v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions. For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences, producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient, end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised long-horizon speech generation.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/MGM-Omni</p></details> |
| **[VoxCPM: Tokenizer-Free TTS for Context-Aware Speech Generation and True-to-Life Voice Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24650v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for speech synthesis face a fundamental trade-off: discrete tokens ensure stability but sacrifice expressivity, while continuous signals retain acoustic richness but suffer from error accumulation due to task entanglement. This challenge has driven the field towards multi-stage pipelines that rely on pre-trained speech tokenizers, but these create a semantic-acoustic divide, limiting holistic and expressive speech generation. We resolve these dilemma through hierarchical semantic-acoustic modeling with semi-discrete residual representations and present a novel tokenizer-free TTS model VoxCPM. Our framework introduces a differentiable quantization bottleneck that induces natural specialization: a Text-Semantic Language Model (TSLM) generates semantic-prosodic plans, while a Residual Acoustic Model (RALM) recovers fine-grained acoustic details. This hierarchical semantic-acoustic representation guides a local diffusion-based decoder to generate high-fidelity speech latents. Critically, the entire architecture is trained end-to-end under a simple diffusion objective, eliminating dependency on external speech tokenizers. Trained on a massive 1.8 million hours of bilingual corpus, our VoxCPM-0.5B model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS performance among open-source systems, demonstrating that our approach delivers expressive and stable synthesis. Besides, VoxCPM shows the capability to comprehend text to infer and generate appropriate prosody and style, delivering speech with context-aware expressiveness and natural flow. To facilitate community-driven research and development, VoxCPM is publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 | Technical Report |
| **[Word-Level Emotional Expression Control in Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24629v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While emotional text-to-speech (TTS) has made significant progress, most existing research remains limited to utterance-level emotional expression and fails to support word-level control. Achieving word-level expressive control poses fundamental challenges, primarily due to the complexity of modeling multi-emotion transitions and the scarcity of annotated datasets that capture intra-sentence emotional and prosodic variation. In this paper, we propose WeSCon, the first self-training framework that enables word-level control of both emotion and speaking rate in a pretrained zero-shot TTS model, without relying on datasets containing intra-sentence emotion or speed transitions. Our method introduces a transition-smoothing strategy and a dynamic speed control mechanism to guide the pretrained TTS model in performing word-level expressive synthesis through a multi-round inference process. To further simplify the inference, we incorporate a dynamic emotional attention bias mechanism and fine-tune the model via self-training, thereby activating its ability for word-level expressive control in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that WeSCon effectively overcomes data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in word-level emotional expression control while preserving the strong zero-shot synthesis capabilities of the original TTS model.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 |  |
| **[FuseCodec: Semantic-Contextual Fusion and Supervision for Neural Codecs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11425v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/mubtasimahasan/FuseCodec.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 |  |
| **[UniFlow-Audio: Unified Flow Matching for Audio Generation from Omni-Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24391v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio generation, including speech, music and sound effects, has advanced rapidly in recent years. These tasks can be divided into two categories: time-aligned (TA) tasks, where each input unit corresponds to a specific segment of the output audio (e.g., phonemes aligned with frames in speech synthesis); and non-time-aligned (NTA) tasks, where such alignment is not available. Since modeling paradigms for the two types are typically different, research on different audio generation tasks has traditionally followed separate trajectories. However, audio is not inherently divided into such categories, making a unified model a natural and necessary goal for general audio generation. Previous unified audio generation works have adopted autoregressive architectures, while unified non-autoregressive approaches remain largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniFlow-Audio, a universal audio generation framework based on flow matching. We propose a dual-fusion mechanism that temporally aligns audio latents with TA features and integrates NTA features via cross-attention in each model block. Task-balanced data sampling is employed to maintain strong performance across both TA and NTA tasks. UniFlow-Audio supports omni-modalities, including text, audio, and video. By leveraging the advantage of multi-task learning and the generative modeling capabilities of flow matching, UniFlow-Audio achieves strong results across 7 tasks using fewer than 8K hours of public training data and under 1B trainable parameters. Even the small variant with only ~200M trainable parameters shows competitive performance, highlighting UniFlow-Audio as a potential non-auto-regressive foundation model for audio generation. Code and models will be available at https://wsntxxn.github.io/uniflow_audio.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wsntxxn.github.io/uniflow_audio</p></details> |
| **[Sidon: Fast and Robust Open-Source Multilingual Speech Restoration for Large-scale Dataset Cleansing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17052v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are limited by the scarcity of clean, multilingual recordings. We introduce Sidon, a fast, open-source speech restoration model that converts noisy in-the-wild speech into studio-quality speech and scales to dozens of languages. Sidon consists of two models: w2v-BERT 2.0 finetuned feature predictor to cleanse features from noisy speech and vocoder trained to synthesize restored speech from the cleansed features. Sidon achieves restoration performance comparable to Miipher: Google's internal speech restoration model with the aim of dataset cleansing for speech synthesis. Sidon is also computationally efficient, running up to 500 times faster than real time on a single GPU. We further show that training a TTS model using a Sidon-cleansed automatic speech recognition corpus improves the quality of synthetic speech in a zero-shot setting. Code and model are released to facilitate reproducible dataset cleansing for the research community.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 | 5 pages, 1 figures |
| **[Generalizable Speech Deepfake Detection via Information Bottleneck Enhanced Adversarial Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23618v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural speech synthesis techniques have enabled highly realistic speech deepfakes, posing major security risks. Speech deepfake detection is challenging due to distribution shifts across spoofing methods and variability in speakers, channels, and recording conditions. We explore learning shared discriminative features as a path to robust detection and propose Information Bottleneck enhanced Confidence-Aware Adversarial Network (IB-CAAN). Confidence-guided adversarial alignment adaptively suppresses attack-specific artifacts without erasing discriminative cues, while the information bottleneck removes nuisance variability to preserve transferable features. Experiments on ASVspoof 2019/2021, ASVspoof 5, and In-the-Wild demonstrate that IB-CAAN consistently outperforms baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks.</p></details> | 2025-09-28 |  |
| **[CapSpeech: Enabling Downstream Applications in Style-Captioned Text-to-Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02863v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS). However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 |  |
| **[Speaker Anonymisation for Speech-based Suicide Risk Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22148v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adolescent suicide is a critical global health issue, and speech provides a cost-effective modality for automatic suicide risk detection. Given the vulnerable population, protecting speaker identity is particularly important, as speech itself can reveal personally identifiable information if the data is leaked or maliciously exploited. This work presents the first systematic study of speaker anonymisation for speech-based suicide risk detection. A broad range of anonymisation methods are investigated, including techniques based on traditional signal processing, neural voice conversion, and speech synthesis. A comprehensive evaluation framework is built to assess the trade-off between protecting speaker identity and preserving information essential for suicide risk detection. Results show that combining anonymisation methods that retain complementary information yields detection performance comparable to that of original speech, while achieving protection of speaker identity for vulnerable populations.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 |  |
| **[Comprehend and Talk: Text to Speech Synthesis via Dual Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22062v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Large Language Model (LLM) based autoregressive (AR) text-to-speech (TTS) systems, while achieving state-of-the-art quality, still face critical challenges. The foundation of this LLM-based paradigm is the discretization of the continuous speech waveform into a sequence of discrete tokens by neural audio codec. However, single codebook modeling is well suited to text LLMs, but suffers from significant information loss; hierarchical acoustic tokens, typically generated via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), often lack explicit semantic structure, placing a heavy learning burden on the model. Furthermore, the autoregressive process is inherently susceptible to error accumulation, which can degrade generation stability. To address these limitations, we propose CaT-TTS, a novel framework for robust and semantically-grounded zero-shot synthesis. First, we introduce S3Codec, a split RVQ codec that injects explicit linguistic features into its primary codebook via semantic distillation from a state-of-the-art ASR model, providing a structured representation that simplifies the learning task. Second, we propose an ``Understand-then-Generate'' dual-Transformer architecture that decouples comprehension from rendering. An initial ``Understanding'' Transformer models the cross-modal relationship between text and the audio's semantic tokens to form a high-level utterance plan. A subsequent ``Generation'' Transformer then executes this plan, autoregressively synthesizing hierarchical acoustic tokens. Finally, to enhance generation stability, we introduce Masked Audio Parallel Inference (MAPI), a nearly parameter-free inference strategy that dynamically guides the decoding process to mitigate local errors.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference paper about TTS</p></details> |
| **[KAME: Tandem Architecture for Enhancing Knowledge in Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Conversational AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02327v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural, low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency, which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency on par with the baseline.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 |  |
| **[Facilitating Personalized TTS for Dysarthric Speakers Using Knowledge Anchoring and Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10412v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dysarthric speakers experience substantial communication challenges due to impaired motor control of the speech apparatus, which leads to reduced speech intelligibility. This creates significant obstacles in dataset curation since actual recording of long, articulate sentences for the objective of training personalized TTS models becomes infeasible. Thus, the limited availability of audio data, in addition to the articulation errors that are present within the audio, complicates personalized speech synthesis for target dysarthric speaker adaptation. To address this, we frame the issue as a domain transfer task and introduce a knowledge anchoring framework that leverages a teacher-student model, enhanced by curriculum learning through audio augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model effectively generates synthetic speech with markedly reduced articulation errors and high speaker fidelity, while maintaining prosodic naturalness.</p></details> | 2025-09-25 | Interspeech 2025 |
| **[UDDETTS: Unifying Discrete and Dimensional Emotions for Controllable Emotional Text-to-Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10599v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have made great progress in the field of text-to-speech (TTS), but they still face major challenges in synthesizing fine-grained emotional speech in an interpretable manner. Traditional methods rely on discrete emotion labels to control emotion categories and intensities, which cannot capture the complexity and continuity of human emotional perception and expression. The lack of large-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and fine-grained emotional annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models and impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose UDDETTS, a universal LLM framework unifying discrete and dimensional emotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the interpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion description and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion labels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised training strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech datasets with different types of emotional annotations to train the UDDETTS. Experiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along three interpretable dimensions, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech synthesis capabilities. Code and demos are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/UDDETTS.</p></details> | 2025-09-25 | Under review |
| **[Objective Evaluation of Prosody and Intelligibility in Speech Synthesis via Conditional Prediction of Discrete Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20485v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate (WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.</p></details> | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for IEEE OJSP</p></details> |
| **[CoMelSinger: Discrete Token-Based Zero-Shot Singing Synthesis With Structured Melody Control and Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19883v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive vocal performances from structured musical inputs such as lyrics and pitch sequences. While recent progress in discrete codec-based speech synthesis has enabled zero-shot generation via in-context learning, directly extending these techniques to SVS remains non-trivial due to the requirement for precise melody control. In particular, prompt-based generation often introduces prosody leakage, where pitch information is inadvertently entangled within the timbre prompt, compromising controllability. We present CoMelSinger, a zero-shot SVS framework that enables structured and disentangled melody control within a discrete codec modeling paradigm. Built on the non-autoregressive MaskGCT architecture, CoMelSinger replaces conventional text inputs with lyric and pitch tokens, preserving in-context generalization while enhancing melody conditioning. To suppress prosody leakage, we propose a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning strategy that explicitly regularizes pitch redundancy between the acoustic prompt and melody input. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight encoder-only Singing Voice Transcription (SVT) module to align acoustic tokens with pitch and duration, offering fine-grained frame-level supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMelSinger achieves notable improvements in pitch accuracy, timbre consistency, and zero-shot transferability over competitive baselines.</p></details> | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Speech Watermarking for Speech Synthesis via Progressive Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19812v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of speech generative models, unauthorized voice cloning poses significant privacy and security risks. Speech watermarking offers a viable solution for tracing sources and preventing misuse. Current watermarking technologies fall mainly into two categories: DSP-based methods and deep learning-based methods. DSP-based methods are efficient but vulnerable to attacks, whereas deep learning-based methods offer robust protection at the expense of significantly higher computational cost. To improve the computational efficiency and enhance the robustness, we propose PKDMark, a lightweight deep learning-based speech watermarking method that leverages progressive knowledge distillation (PKD). Our approach proceeds in two stages: (1) training a high-performance teacher model using an invertible neural network-based architecture, and (2) transferring the teacher's capabilities to a compact student model through progressive knowledge distillation. This process reduces computational costs by 93.6% while maintaining high level of robust performance and imperceptibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled model achieves an average detection F1 score of 99.6% with a PESQ of 4.30 in advanced distortions, enabling efficient speech watermarking for real-time speech synthesis applications.</p></details> | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages of main text, 1 page of references, 2 figures, 2 tables,

| **[Selective Classifier-free Guidance for Zero-shot Text-to-speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19668v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In zero-shot text-to-speech, achieving a balance between fidelity to the target speaker and adherence to text content remains a challenge. While classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategies have shown promising results in image generation, their application to speech synthesis are underexplored. Separating the conditions used for CFG enables trade-offs between different desired characteristics in speech synthesis. In this paper, we evaluate the adaptability of CFG strategies originally developed for image generation to speech synthesis and extend separated-condition CFG approaches for this domain. Our results show that CFG strategies effective in image generation generally fail to improve speech synthesis. We also find that we can improve speaker similarity while limiting degradation of text adherence by applying standard CFG during early timesteps and switching to selective CFG only in later timesteps. Surprisingly, we observe that the effectiveness of a selective CFG strategy is highly text-representation dependent, as differences between the two languages of English and Mandarin can lead to different results even with the same model.</p></details> | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

| **[SupertonicTTS: Towards Highly Efficient and Streamlined Text-to-Speech System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23108v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SupertonicTTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for efficient and streamlined speech synthesis. SupertonicTTS comprises three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. The TTS pipeline is further simplified by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we propose context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment with minimal memory and I/O overhead.

| **[HD-PPT: Hierarchical Decoding of Content- and Prompt-Preference Tokens for Instruction-based TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19001v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have already reached a high degree of naturalness. However, the precision control of TTS inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis. Audio samples are available at https://xxh333.github.io/.</p></details> | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ICASSP2026</p></details> |

The lack of high-quality omnimodal datasets and the challenges of real-time emotional speech synthesis have notably hindered progress in open-source research. To address these limitations, we introduce \name, a two-stage training framework that integrates omnimodal alignment and speech generation to develop a state-of-the-art omnimodal large language model. In the alignment phase, a pre-trained speech model undergoes further training on text-image tasks, enabling (near) zero-shot generalization from vision to speech, outperforming models trained on tri-modal datasets. In the speech generation phase, a lightweight decoder is trained on speech tasks with direct preference optimization, enabling real-time emotional speech synthesis with high fidelity. Experiments show that \name surpasses state-of-the-art models across omnimodal, vision-language, and speech-language benchmarks. It achieves a 4-point absolute improvement on OmniBench over the leading open-source model VITA, despite using 5x fewer training samples and a smaller model size (7B vs. 7x8B). Additionally, \name achieves real-time speech generation with <1s latency at non-autoregressive mode, reducing inference time by 5x compared to autoregressive methods, and improves emotion classification accuracy by 7.7\%</p></details> | 2025-09-23 |  |
| **[Discrete-time diffusion-like models for speech synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18470v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.</p></details> | 2025-09-22 |  |

To address this issue, we propose TMD-TTS, a unified Tibetan multi-dialect text-to-speech (TTS) framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from explicit dialect labels. Our method features a dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that TMD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in dialectal expressiveness. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging Speech-to-Speech Dialect Conversion (S2SDC) task.</p></details> | 2025-09-22 |  |
| **[Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2025-09-20 |  |

However, most current flow-matching-based TTS models still rely on reference transcripts corresponding to the audio prompt for synthesis. This dependency prevents cross-lingual voice cloning when audio prompt transcripts are unavailable, particularly for unseen languages. The key challenges for flow-matching-based TTS models to remove audio prompt transcripts are identifying word boundaries during training and determining appropriate duration during inference. In this paper, we introduce Cross-Lingual F5-TTS, a framework that enables cross-lingual voice cloning without audio prompt transcripts. Our method preprocesses audio prompts by forced alignment to obtain word boundaries, enabling direct synthesis from audio prompts while excluding transcripts during training. To address the duration modeling challenge, we train speaking rate predictors at different linguistic granularities to derive duration from speaker pace. Experiments show that our approach matches the performance of F5-TTS while enabling cross-lingual voice cloning.</p></details> | 2025-09-20 | 5 pages, 2 figures |

While existing video-to-audio (V2A) methods mainly focus on Foley sound generation, they struggle to produce intelligible speech. Meanwhile, current environmental speech synthesis approaches remain text-driven and fail to temporally align with dynamic video content. In this paper, we propose Beyond Video-to-SFX (BVS), a method to generate synchronized audio with environmentally aware intelligible speech for given videos. We introduce a two-stage modeling method: (1) stage one is a video-guided audio semantic (V2AS) model to predict unified audio semantic tokens conditioned on phonetic cues; (2) stage two is a video-conditioned semantic-to-acoustic (VS2A) model that refines semantic tokens into detailed acoustic tokens. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BVS in scenarios such as video-to-context-aware speech synthesis and immersive audio background conversion, with ablation studies further validating our design. Our demonstration is available at~\href{https://xinleiniu.github.io/BVS-demo/}{BVS-Demo}.</p></details> | 2025-09-19 |  |

By leveraging separate speaker and environment prompts, DAIEN-TTS allows independent control over the timbre and the background environment of the synthesized speech. Built upon F5-TTS, the proposed DAIEN-TTS first incorporates a pretrained speech-environment separation (SES) module to disentangle the environmental speech into mel-spectrograms of clean speech and environment audio. Two random span masks of varying lengths are then applied to both mel-spectrograms, which, together with the text embedding, serve as conditions for infilling the masked environmental mel-spectrogram, enabling the simultaneous continuation of personalized speech and time-varying environmental audio. To further enhance controllability during inference, we adopt dual class-free guidance (DCFG) for the speech and environment components and introduce a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation strategy to align the synthesized speech with the environment prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that DAIEN-TTS generates environmental personalized speech with high naturalness, strong speaker similarity, and high environmental fidelity.</p></details> | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Existing methods model speaker characteristics through speaker conditioning during training, leading to increased model complexity and limiting reproducibility and accessibility. A low-complexity alternative would broaden the reach of speech synthesis research, particularly in settings with limited computational and data resources. To this end, we propose SelectTTS, a simple and effective alternative. SelectTTS selects appropriate frames from the target speaker and decodes them using frame-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features. We demonstrate that this approach can effectively capture speaker characteristics for unseen speakers and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art multi-speaker TTS frameworks on both objective and subjective metrics. By directly selecting frames from the target speaker's speech, SelectTTS enables generalization to unseen speakers with significantly lower model complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art systems such as XTTS-v2 and VALL-E, while requiring over 8x fewer parameters and 270x less training data. Moreover, it demonstrates that frame selection with SSL features offers an efficient path to low-complexity, high-quality multi-speaker TTS.</p></details> | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for IEEE OJSP</p></details> |
| **[KALL-E:Autoregressive Speech Synthesis with Next-Distribution Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16846v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce KALL-E, a novel autoregressive (AR) language model for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis that operates by predicting the next distribution of continuous speech frames. Unlike existing methods, KALL-E directly models the continuous speech distribution conditioned on text, eliminating the need for any diffusion-based components. Specifically, we utilize a Flow-VAE to extract a continuous latent speech representation from waveforms, instead of relying on discrete speech tokens. A single AR Transformer is then trained to predict these continuous speech distributions from text, optimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss as its objective. Experimental results demonstrate that KALL-E achieves superior speech synthesis quality and can even adapt to a target speaker from just a single sample. Importantly, KALL-E provides a more direct and effective approach for utilizing continuous speech representations in TTS.</p></details> | 2025-09-17 | 6 figures, 5 tables |
| **[Progressive Facial Granularity Aggregation with Bilateral Attribute-based Enhancement for Face-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07376v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For individuals who have experienced traumatic events such as strokes, speech may no longer be a viable means of communication. While text-to-speech (TTS) can be used as a communication aid since it generates synthetic speech, it fails to preserve the user's own voice. As such, face-to-voice (FTV) synthesis, which derives corresponding voices from facial images, provides a promising alternative. However, existing methods rely on pre-trained visual encoders, and finetune them to align with speech embeddings, which strips fine-grained information from facial inputs such as gender or ethnicity, despite their known correlation with vocal traits. Moreover, these pipelines are multi-stage, which requires separate training of multiple components, thus leading to training inefficiency. To address these limitations, we utilize fine-grained facial attribute modeling by decomposing facial images into non-overlapping segments and progressively integrating them into a multi-granular representation. This representation is further refined through multi-task learning of speaker attributes such as gender and ethnicity at both the visual and acoustic domains. Moreover, to improve alignment robustness, we adopt a multi-view training strategy by pairing various visual perspectives of a speaker in terms of different angles and lighting conditions, with identical speech recordings. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations confirm that our approach substantially enhances face-voice congruence and synthesis stability.</p></details> | 2025-09-14 | EMNLP Findings |
| **[DiFlow-TTS: Discrete Flow Matching with Factorized Speech Tokens for Low-Latency Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09631v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample, requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness, prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to 25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.</p></details> | 2025-09-12 |  |

Existing DiT-based text-to-speech (TTS) model acceleration approaches mainly focus on reducing sampling steps through distillation techniques, yet they remain constrained by training costs. We introduce DiTReducio, a training-free acceleration framework that compresses computations in DiT-based TTS models via progressive calibration. We propose two compression methods, Temporal Skipping and Branch Skipping, to eliminate redundant computations during inference. Moreover, based on two characteristic attention patterns identified within DiT layers, we devise a pattern-guided strategy to selectively apply the compression methods. Our method allows flexible modulation between generation quality and computational efficiency through adjustable compression thresholds. Experimental evaluations conducted on F5-TTS and MegaTTS 3 demonstrate that DiTReducio achieves a 75.4% reduction in FLOPs and improves the Real-Time Factor (RTF) by 37.1%, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> | 2025-09-11 |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a novel training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech. Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly. Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions with cross-modal information.</p></details> | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the ISCA SLaTE-2025 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[When Fine-Tuning is Not Enough: Lessons from HSAD on Hybrid and Adversarial Audio Spoof Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07323v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI has enabled highly realistic speech synthesis and voice cloning, posing serious risks to voice authentication, smart assistants, and telecom security. While most prior work frames spoof detection as a binary task, real-world attacks often involve hybrid utterances that mix genuine and synthetic speech, making detection substantially more challenging. To address this gap, we introduce the Hybrid Spoofed Audio Dataset (HSAD), a benchmark containing 1,248 clean and 41,044 degraded utterances across four classes: human, cloned, zero-shot AI-generated, and hybrid audio. Each sample is annotated with spoofing method, speaker identity, and degradation metadata to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate six transformer-based models, including spectrogram encoders (MIT-AST, MattyB95-AST) and self-supervised waveform models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT). Results reveal critical lessons: pretrained models overgeneralize and collapse under hybrid conditions; spoof-specific fine-tuning improves separability but struggles with unseen compositions; and dataset-specific adaptation on HSAD yields large performance gains (AST greater than 97 percent and F1 score is approximately 99 percent), though residual errors persist for complex hybrids. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuning alone is not sufficient-robust hybrid-aware benchmarks like HSAD are essential to expose calibration failures, model biases, and factors affecting spoof detection in adversarial environments. HSAD thus provides both a dataset and an analytic framework for building resilient and trustworthy voice authentication systems.</p></details> | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures.This work has been submitted to the IEEE for

The latest work predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of prosodic expressiveness.

These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks, reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and automated evaluation.</p></details> | 2025-09-05 | 10 pages, 4 figures |

This uniform token allocation mismatches the intrinsic structure of speech, where information is distributed unevenly over time. To address this, we propose VARSTok, a VAriable-frame-Rate Speech Tokenizer that adapts token allocation based on local feature similarity. VARSTok introduces two key innovations: (1) a temporal-aware density peak clustering algorithm that adaptively segments speech into variable-length units, and (2) a novel implicit duration coding scheme that embeds both content and temporal span into a single token index, eliminating the need for auxiliary duration predictors. Extensive experiments show that VARSTok significantly outperforms strong fixed-rate baselines. Notably, it achieves superior reconstruction naturalness while using up to 23% fewer tokens than a 40 Hz fixed-frame-rate baseline. VARSTok further yields lower word error rates and improved naturalness in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that a fully dynamic, variable-frame-rate acoustic speech tokenizer can be seamlessly integrated into downstream speech language models.

To improve content encoding under strict latency constraints, DarkStream combines a causal waveform encoder, a short lookahead buffer, and transformer-based contextual layers. To further reduce inference time, the model generates waveforms directly via a neural vocoder, thus removing intermediate mel-spectrogram conversions. Finally, DarkStream anonymizes speaker identity by injecting a GAN-generated pseudo-speaker embedding into linguistic features from the content encoder. Evaluations show our model achieves strong anonymization, yielding close to 50% speaker verification EER (near-chance performance) on the lazy-informed attack scenario, while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within 9%). By balancing low-latency, robust privacy, and minimal intelligibility degradation, DarkStream provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving real-time speech communication.</p></details> | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ASRU 2025</p></details> |

Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed, their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale, highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice, underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.

| **[Exposing Synthetic Speech: Model Attribution and Detection of AI-generated Speech via Audio Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As speech generation technologies continue to advance in quality and accessibility, the risk of malicious use cases, including impersonation, misinformation, and spoofing, increases rapidly. This work addresses this threat by introducing a simple, training-free, yet effective approach for detecting AI-generated speech and attributing it to its source model. Specifically, we tackle three key tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether a given audio sample was generated by a specific target neural speech synthesis system (with access only to data from that system); (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world setting, where the objective is to identify the generating system from a known pool of candidates; and last but not least (3) detection of synthetic versus real speech. Our approach leverages standardized average residuals-the difference between an input audio signal and its filtered version using either a low-pass filter or the EnCodec audio autoencoder. We demonstrate that these residuals consistently capture artifacts introduced by diverse speech synthesis systems, serving as distinctive, model-agnostic fingerprints for attribution. Across extensive experiments, our approach achieves AUROC scores exceeding 99% in most scenarios, evaluated on augmented benchmark datasets that pair real speech with synthetic audio generated by multiple synthesis systems. In addition, our robustness analysis underscores the method's ability to maintain high performance even in the presence of moderate additive noise. Due to its simplicity, efficiency, and strong generalization across speech synthesis systems and languages, this technique offers a practical tool for digital forensics and security applications.</p></details> | 2025-09-04 |  |

We present two open-source dual-track conversational speech datasets, one in Chinese and one in English, designed to enhance the naturalness of synthesized speech by providing more realistic conversational data. The two datasets contain a total of 15 hours of natural, spontaneous conversations recorded in isolated rooms, which produces separate high-quality audio tracks for each speaker. The conversations cover diverse daily topics and domains, capturing realistic interaction patterns including frequent overlaps, backchannel responses, laughter, and other non-verbal vocalizations. We introduce the data collection procedure, transcription and annotation methods. We demonstrate the utility of these corpora by fine-tuning a baseline TTS model with the proposed datasets. The fine-tuned TTS model achieves higher subjective and objective evaluation metrics compared to the baseline, indicating improved naturalness and conversational realism in synthetic speech. All data, annotations, and supporting code for fine-tuning and evaluation are made available to facilitate further research in conversational speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2025-09-04 |  |
| **[LibriQuote: A Speech Dataset of Fictional Character Utterances for Expressive Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04072v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear. Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally, we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at https://libriquote.github.io/.</p></details> | 2025-09-04 |  |
| **[Multi-level SSL Feature Gating for Audio Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03409v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly in speech synthesis, have enabled the generation of highly natural-sounding synthetic speech that closely mimics human voices. While these innovations hold promise for applications like assistive technologies, they also pose significant risks, including misuse for fraudulent activities, identity theft, and security threats. Current research on spoofing detection countermeasures remains limited by generalization to unseen deepfake attacks and languages. To address this, we propose a gating mechanism extracting relevant feature from the speech foundation XLS-R model as a front-end feature extractor. For downstream back-end classifier, we employ Multi-kernel gated Convolution (MultiConv) to capture both local and global speech artifacts. Additionally, we introduce Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a similarity metric to enforce diversity in learned features across different MultiConv layers. By integrating CKA with our gating mechanism, we hypothesize that each component helps improving the learning of distinct synthetic speech patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks while generalizing robustly to out-of-domain datasets, including multilingual speech samples. This underscores its potential as a versatile solution for detecting evolving speech deepfake threats.</p></details> | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

By leveraging the autoregressive nature of language models and the generative efficacy of flow matching, FELLE effectively predicts continuous-valued tokens (mel-spectrograms). For each continuous-valued token, FELLE modifies the general prior distribution in flow matching by incorporating information from the previous step, improving coherence and stability. Furthermore, to enhance synthesis quality, FELLE introduces a coarse-to-fine flow-matching mechanism, generating continuous-valued tokens hierarchically, conditioned on the language model's output. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of incorporating flow-matching techniques in autoregressive mel-spectrogram modeling, leading to significant improvements in TTS generation quality, as shown in https://aka.ms/felle.</p></details> | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

| **[FreeTalk:A plug-and-play and black-box defense against speech synthesis attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00561v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, speech assistant and speech verification have been used in many fields, which brings much benefit and convenience for us. However, when we enjoy these speech applications, our speech may be collected by attackers for speech synthesis. For example, an attacker generates some inappropriate political opinions with the characteristic of the victim's voice by obtaining a piece of the victim's speech, which will greatly influence the victim's reputation. Specifically, with the appearance of some zero-shot voice conversion methods, the cost of speech synthesis attacks has been further reduced, which also brings greater challenges to user voice security and privacy. Some researchers have proposed the corresponding privacy-preserving methods. However, the existing approaches have some non-negligible drawbacks: low transferability and robustness, high computational overhead. These deficiencies seriously limit the existing method deployed in practical scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight, robust, plug-and-play privacy preservation method against speech synthesis attacks in a black-box setting. Our method generates and adds a frequency-domain perturbation to the original speech to achieve privacy protection and high speech quality. Then, we present a data augmentation strategy and noise smoothing mechanism to improve the robustness of the proposed method. Besides, to reduce the user's defense overhead, we also propose a novel identity-wise protection mechanism. It can generate a universal perturbation for one speaker and support privacy preservation for speech of any length. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 speech synthesis models, 5 speech verification models, 1 speech recognition model, and 2 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has satisfying privacy-preserving performance, high speech quality, and utility.</p></details> | 2025-08-30 | under review |

However, existing zero-shot TTS models face challenges in capturing the complex correlations between acoustic and semantic features, resulting in a lack of expressiveness and similarity. The primary reason lies in the complex relationship between semantic and acoustic features, which manifests independent and interdependent aspects.This paper introduces a TTS framework that combines both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) modules to harmonize the independence and interdependence of acoustic and semantic information. The AR model leverages the proposed Parallel Tokenizer to synthesize the top semantic and acoustic tokens simultaneously. In contrast, considering the interdependence, the Coupled NAR model predicts detailed tokens based on the general AR model's output. Parallel GPT, built on this architecture, is designed to improve zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis through its parallel structure. Experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the quality and efficiency of the synthesis of existing zero-shot TTS models.

While end-to-end approaches promise theoretical advantages, cascaded systems (CSs) continue to outperform them in language understanding tasks, despite being constrained by sequential processing latency. In this work, we introduce ChipChat, a novel low-latency CS that overcomes traditional bottlenecks through architectural innovations and streaming optimizations. Our system integrates streaming (a) conversational speech recognition with mixture-of-experts, (b) state-action augmented LLM, (c) text-to-speech synthesis, (d) neural vocoder, and (e) speaker modeling. Implemented using MLX, ChipChat achieves sub-second response latency on a Mac Studio without dedicated GPUs, while preserving user privacy through complete on-device processing. Our work shows that strategically redesigned CSs can overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path forward for practical voice-based AI agents.</p></details> | 2025-08-26 | ASRU 2025 |

Existing defenses typically inject noise into human speech to compromise voice encoders in speech synthesis models. However, these methods degrade audio quality and require prior knowledge of the attack approaches, limiting their effectiveness in diverse scenarios. Moreover, real-time audios, such as speech in virtual meetings and voice messages, are still exposed to voice deepfake threats. To overcome these limitations, we propose ClearMask, a noise-free defense mechanism against voice deepfake attacks. Unlike traditional approaches, ClearMask modifies the audio mel-spectrogram by selectively filtering certain frequencies, inducing a transferable voice feature loss without injecting noise. We then apply audio style transfer to further deceive voice decoders while preserving perceived sound quality. Finally, optimized reverberation is introduced to disrupt the output of voice generation models without affecting the naturalness of the speech. Additionally, we develop LiveMask to protect streaming speech in real-time through a universal frequency filter and reverberation generator. Our experimental results show that ClearMask and LiveMask effectively prevent voice deepfake attacks from deceiving speaker verification models and human listeners, even for unseen voice synthesis models and black-box API services. Furthermore, ClearMask demonstrates resilience against adaptive attackers who attempt to recover the original audio signal from the protected speech samples.</p></details> | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, Accepted by AsiaCCS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume, and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2% F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural French speech.

In this paper, we propose a Code-Switched Large Language Model (CS-LLM) to enhance the code-switched text-to-speech synthesis (CS TTS) capability in LLMs with only monolingual corpora. Specifically, we begin by enhancing the multilingual speech processing ability of LLMs through multilingual speech recognition and synthesis tasks. Then, we develop an effective code-switched (CS) data construction strategy that splits and concatenates words from different monolingual speech corpora to equip LLMs with improved CS TTS ability. Experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines in CS TTS in terms of naturalness, speaker consistency and similarity even with limited data. Additionally, the constructed CS data further improves multilingual speech synthesis and recognition.</p></details> | 2025-08-22 | Accepted to ASRU2025 |

These methods overlook the contextual coherence of paragraphs, leading to reduced naturalness and inconsistencies in style and timbre across the long-form speech. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware Memory (CAM)-based long-context Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. The CAM block integrates and retrieves both long-term memory and local context details, enabling dynamic memory updates and transfers within long paragraphs to guide sentence-level speech synthesis. Furthermore, the prefix mask enhances the in-context learning ability by enabling bidirectional attention on prefix tokens while maintaining unidirectional generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art long-context methods in terms of prosody expressiveness, coherence and context inference cost across paragraph-level speech.</p></details> | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech25</p></details> |

These features are fed into the DDSP vocoder to synthesize the enhanced waveform. The system is trained end-to-end with STFT and adversarial losses, enabling direct optimization at the feature and waveform levels. Experimental results show that our method improves intelligibility and quality by 4% (STOI) and 19% (DNSMOS) over strong baselines without significantly increasing computation, making it well-suited for real-time applications.</p></details> | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and

To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel approach that integrates feedback loss from a bi-modal sarcasm detection model into the TTS training process, enhancing the model's ability to capture and convey sarcasm. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning, a speech synthesis model pre-trained on read speech undergoes a two-stage fine-tuning process.

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual modality awareness during generation. This paper presents DrVoice, a parallel speech-text voice conversation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring dual-resolution speech representations. Whereas current methods utilize mainly 12.5Hz input audio representation, our proposed dual-resolution mechanism reduces the input frequency for the LLM to 5Hz. Experimental results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that D RVOICE establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among similar size speech foundation models with relative small amount of data.</p></details> | 2025-08-08 | Work in progress |

However, existing autoregressive (AR) structures and large-scale models, such as Llasa, still face significant challenges in inference latency and streaming synthesis. To deal with the limitations, we introduce Llasa+, an accelerated and streaming TTS model built on Llasa. Specifically, to accelerate the generation process, we introduce two plug-and-play Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) modules following the frozen backbone. These modules allow the model to predict multiple tokens in one AR step. Additionally, to mitigate potential error propagation caused by inaccurate MTP, we design a novel verification algorithm that leverages the frozen backbone to validate the generated tokens, thus allowing Llasa+ to achieve speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Furthermore, we design a causal decoder that enables streaming speech reconstruction from tokens. Extensive experiments show that Llasa+ achieves a 1.48X speedup without sacrificing generation quality, despite being trained only on LibriTTS.

| **[A Scalable Pipeline for Enabling Non-Verbal Speech Generation and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05385v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human spoken communication involves not only lexical content but also non-verbal vocalizations (NVs) such as laughter, sighs, and coughs, which convey emotions, intentions, and social signals. However, most existing speech systems focus solely on verbal content and lack the ability to understand and generate such non-verbal cues, reducing the emotional intelligence and communicative richness of spoken interfaces. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{NonVerbalSpeech-38K}$, a large and diverse dataset for non-verbal speech generation and understanding, collected from real-world media and annotated using an automatic pipeline. The dataset contains 38,718 samples (about 131 hours) with 10 categories of non-verbal cues, such as laughter, sniff, and throat clearing. We further validate the dataset by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models, including F5-TTS and Qwen2-Audio, demonstrating its effectiveness in non-verbal speech generation and understanding tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose a practical pipeline for building natural and diverse non-verbal speech datasets; (2) We release a large-scale dataset to advance research on non-verbal speech generation and understanding; (3) We validate the dataset's effectiveness by demonstrating improvements in both non-verbal speech synthesis and captioning, thereby facilitating richer human-computer interaction.</p></details> | 2025-08-07 |  |
| **[NVSpeech: An Integrated and Scalable Pipeline for Human-Like Speech Modeling with Paralinguistic Vocalizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04195v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paralinguistic vocalizations-including non-verbal sounds like laughter and breathing, as well as lexicalized interjections such as "uhm" and "oh"-are integral to natural spoken communication. Despite their importance in conveying affect, intent, and interactional cues, such cues remain largely overlooked in conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We present NVSpeech, an integrated and scalable pipeline that bridges the recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations, encompassing dataset construction, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS. (1) We introduce a manually annotated dataset of 48,430 human-spoken utterances with 18 word-level paralinguistic categories. (2) We develop the paralinguistic-aware ASR model, which treats paralinguistic cues as inline decodable tokens (e.g., "You're so funny [Laughter]"), enabling joint lexical and non-verbal transcription. This model is then used to automatically annotate a large corpus, the first large-scale Chinese dataset of 174,179 utterances (573 hours) with word-level alignment and paralingustic cues. (3) We finetune zero-shot TTS models on both human- and auto-labeled data to enable explicit control over paralinguistic vocalizations, allowing context-aware insertion at arbitrary token positions for human-like speech synthesis. By unifying the recognition and generation of paralinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale, word-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin, integrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner.

To address this gap, we introduce MahaTTS-v2 a Multilingual Multi-speaker Text-To-Speech (TTS) system that has excellent multilingual expressive capabilities in Indic languages. The model has been trained on around 20K hours of data specifically focused on Indian languages. Our approach leverages Wav2Vec2.0 tokens for semantic extraction, and a Language Model (LM) for text-to-semantic modeling. Additionally, we have used a Conditional Flow Model (CFM) for semantics to melspectogram generation. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over other frameworks. Our code is available at https://github.com/dubverse-ai/MahaTTSv2</p></details> | 2025-08-05 |  |
| **[Pseudo-Autoregressive Neural Codec Language Models for Efficient Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10352v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems face a common dilemma: autoregressive (AR) models suffer from slow generation and lack duration controllability, while non-autoregressive (NAR) models lack temporal modeling and typically require complex designs. In this paper, we introduce a novel pseudo-autoregressive (PAR) codec language modeling approach that unifies AR and NAR modeling. Combining explicit temporal modeling from AR with parallel generation from NAR, PAR generates dynamic-length spans at fixed time steps. Building on PAR, we propose PALLE, a two-stage TTS system that leverages PAR for initial generation followed by NAR refinement. In the first stage, PAR progressively generates speech tokens along the time dimension, with each step predicting all positions in parallel but only retaining the left-most span. In the second stage, low-confidence tokens are iteratively refined in parallel, leveraging the global contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that PALLE, trained on LibriTTS, outperforms state-of-the-art systems trained on large-scale data, including F5-TTS, E2-TTS, and MaskGCT, on the LibriSpeech test-clean set in terms of speech quality, speaker similarity, and intelligibility, while achieving up to ten times faster inference speed.

However, achieving intelligible and natural speech remains challenging due to limitations in feature representation, prosody modeling, and phase reconstruction. We introduce MiSTR, a deep-learning framework that integrates: 1) Wavelet-based feature extraction to capture fine-grained temporal, spectral, and neurophysiological representations of iEEG signals, 2) A Transformer-based decoder for prosody-aware spectrogram prediction, and 3) A neural phase vocoder enforcing harmonic consistency via adaptive spectral correction. Evaluated on a public iEEG dataset, MiSTR achieves state-of-the-art speech intelligibility, with a mean Pearson correlation of 0.91 between reconstructed and original Mel spectrograms, improving over existing neural speech synthesis baselines.</p></details> | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[MuteSwap: Visual-informed Silent Video Identity Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00498v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.</p></details> | 2025-08-03 |  |
| **[Next Tokens Denoising for Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22746v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens per second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and utilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model highly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts. Experiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.</p></details> | 2025-08-01 |  |
| **[SpeechFake: A Large-Scale Multilingual Speech Deepfake Dataset Incorporating Cutting-Edge Generation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21463v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As speech generation technology advances, the risk of misuse through deepfake audio has become a pressing concern, which underscores the critical need for robust detection systems. However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools. The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest cutting-edge methods. It also provides multilingual support, spanning 46 languages. In this paper, we offer a detailed overview of the dataset's creation, composition, and statistics. We also present baseline results by training detection models on SpeechFake, demonstrating strong performance on both its own test sets and various unseen test sets. Additionally, we conduct experiments to rigorously explore how generation methods, language diversity, and speaker variation affect detection performance. We believe SpeechFake will be a valuable resource for advancing speech deepfake detection and developing more robust models for evolving generation techniques.</p></details> | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACL 2025.

| **[Defining ethically sourced code generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19743v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing, privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices. To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen. Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.</p></details> | 2025-07-26 |  |

By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech. We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording. To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three metrics studied.</p></details> | 2025-07-23 |  |

Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups.

| **[SplitMeanFlow: Interval Splitting Consistency in Few-Step Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16884v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models like Flow Matching have achieved state-of-the-art performance but are often hindered by a computationally expensive iterative sampling process. To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations, resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x.</p></details> | 2025-07-22 | Tech Report |

These demographics possess distinct vocal characteristics, linguistic styles, and interaction patterns that challenge conventional ASR, TTS, and LLM systems. To address this, we introduce EchoVoices, an end-to-end digital human pipeline dedicated to creating persistent digital personas for seniors and children, ensuring their voices and memories are preserved for future generations. Our system integrates three core innovations: a k-NN-enhanced Whisper model for robust speech recognition of atypical speech; an age-adaptive VITS model for high-fidelity, speaker-aware speech synthesis; and an LLM-driven agent that automatically generates persona cards and leverages a RAG-based memory system for conversational consistency. Our experiments, conducted on the SeniorTalk and ChildMandarin datasets, demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy, synthesis quality, and speaker similarity. EchoVoices provides a comprehensive framework for preserving generational voices, offering a new means of intergenerational connection and the creation of lasting digital legacies.</p></details> | 2025-07-21 |  |

In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso, using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics, including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive TTS research.

| **[Speak, Edit, Repeat: High-Fidelity Voice Editing and Zero-Shot TTS with Cross-Attentive Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04738v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MAVE (Mamba with Cross-Attention for Voice Editing and Synthesis), a novel autoregressive architecture for text-conditioned voice editing and high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, built on a cross-attentive Mamba backbone. MAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech editing and very competitive results in zero-shot TTS, while not being explicitly trained on the latter task, outperforming leading autoregressive and diffusion models on diverse, real-world audio. By integrating Mamba for efficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise text-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with exceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations on a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2% of listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original, while 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the majority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source. MAVE compares favorably with VoiceCraft and FluentSpeech both on pairwise comparisons and standalone mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations. For zero-shot TTS, MAVE exceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without requiring multiple inference runs or post-processing. Remarkably, these quality gains come with a significantly lower memory cost and approximately the same latency: MAVE requires ~6x less memory than VoiceCraft during inference on utterances from the RealEdit database (mean duration: 6.21s, A100, FP16, batch size 1). Our results demonstrate that MAVE establishes a new standard for flexible, high-fidelity voice editing and synthesis through the synergistic integration of structured state-space modeling and cross-modal attention.</p></details> | 2025-10-06 |  |
| **[UniVoice: Unifying Autoregressive ASR and Flow-Matching based TTS with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04593v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems, gradually becoming the mainstream approach. However, most current approaches address these tasks separately rather than through a unified framework. This work aims to integrate these two tasks into one unified model. Although discrete speech tokenization enables joint modeling, its inherent information loss limits performance in both recognition and generation. In this work, we present UniVoice, a unified LLM framework through continuous representations that seamlessly integrates speech recognition and synthesis within a single model. Our approach combines the strengths of autoregressive modeling for speech recognition with flow matching for high-quality generation. To mitigate the inherent divergence between autoregressive and flow-matching models, we further design a dual attention mechanism, which switches between a causal mask for recognition and a bidirectional attention mask for synthesis. Furthermore, the proposed text-prefix-conditioned speech infilling method enables high-fidelity zero-shot voice cloning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve or exceed current single-task modeling methods in both ASR and zero-shot TTS tasks. This work explores new possibilities for end-to-end speech understanding and generation.</p></details> | 2025-10-06 |  |
| **[VoxCPM: Tokenizer-Free TTS for Context-Aware Speech Generation and True-to-Life Voice Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24650v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for speech synthesis face a fundamental trade-off: discrete tokens ensure stability but sacrifice expressivity, while continuous signals retain acoustic richness but suffer from error accumulation due to task entanglement. This challenge has driven the field towards multi-stage pipelines that rely on pre-trained speech tokenizers, but these create a semantic-acoustic divide, limiting holistic and expressive speech generation. We resolve these dilemma through hierarchical semantic-acoustic modeling with semi-discrete residual representations and present a novel tokenizer-free TTS model VoxCPM. Our framework introduces a differentiable quantization bottleneck that induces natural specialization: a Text-Semantic Language Model (TSLM) generates semantic-prosodic plans, while a Residual Acoustic Model (RALM) recovers fine-grained acoustic details. This hierarchical semantic-acoustic representation guides a local diffusion-based decoder to generate high-fidelity speech latents. Critically, the entire architecture is trained end-to-end under a simple diffusion objective, eliminating dependency on external speech tokenizers. Trained on a massive 1.8 million hours of bilingual corpus, our VoxCPM-0.5B model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS performance among open-source systems, demonstrating that our approach delivers expressive and stable synthesis. Besides, VoxCPM shows the capability to comprehend text to infer and generate appropriate prosody and style, delivering speech with context-aware expressiveness and natural flow. To facilitate community-driven research and development, VoxCPM is publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 | Technical Report |

Recent LLM-TTS systems achieve strong controllability and zero-shot generalization, but their large parameter counts and high latency limit real-world deployment. SPADE addresses this by combining (i) a pruning step guided by a word-error-rate-based layer importance index to remove non-essential Transformer layers, with (ii) multi-level knowledge distillation to restore autoregressive coherence. On zero-shot benchmarks, SPADE preserves near-parity perceptual quality while halving Transformer depth, reducing VRAM usage by up to 20%, and achieving up to 1.7x faster real-time factor with less than 5% of the original training data. These results show that compact LLM-TTS models can maintain naturalness and speaker similarity while enabling practical real-time speech generation.

In contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts. We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens. Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages, substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

This creates significant obstacles in dataset curation since actual recording of long, articulate sentences for the objective of training personalized TTS models becomes infeasible. Thus, the limited availability of audio data, in addition to the articulation errors that are present within the audio, complicates personalized speech synthesis for target dysarthric speaker adaptation. To address this, we frame the issue as a domain transfer task and introduce a knowledge anchoring framework that leverages a teacher-student model, enhanced by curriculum learning through audio augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model effectively generates synthetic speech with markedly reduced articulation errors and high speaker fidelity, while maintaining prosodic naturalness.</p></details> | 2025-09-25 | Interspeech 2025 |

To address these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable, open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.</p></details> | 2025-09-25 | 5 pages, 2 figures |

First, we analyzed the alignment mechanism between text tokens and speech tokens in LLMs. We then proposed a metric termed the Optimal Alignment Score (OAS), which employs the Viterbi algorithm to evaluate text-speech alignment quality. Subsequently, OAS was integrated into the training of CosyVoice2 to assist LLMs in learning continuous, stable alignment. Additionally, the pre-trained attention value is employed to guide the training of the student CosyVoice2 via chain-of-thought (CoT), which further reduces stability hallucinations in synthesized speech. Experiments on the Seed-TTS-Eval and CV3-Eval test sets demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the stability hallucinations of CosyVoice2 without introducing additional negative effects.

Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis.

| **[Explore the Reinforcement Learning for the LLM based ASR and TTS system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18569v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have played an important role in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced LLM performance in text-based tasks, its application to ASR and TTS remains underexplored due to the complexity of training audio-based models. In this study, we propose a lightweight RL framework tailored for audio-based LLMs that can process audio inputs and generate audio outputs. Based on this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve improved performance. Our experiments demonstrate that RL can significantly enhance the performance of both ASR and TTS systems, even with limited training data and a small number of optimization steps.</p></details> | 2025-09-23 |  |
| **[No Verifiable Reward for Prosody: Toward Preference-Guided Prosody Learning in TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18531v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work reports gains in neural text-to-speech (TTS) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, in the absence of a verifiable reward for \textit{prosody}, GRPO trained on transcription-oriented signals (CER/NLL) lowers error rates yet collapses prosody into monotone, unnatural speech; adding speaker-similarity further destabilizes training and degrades CER. We address this with an \textit{iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)} scheme that uses only a few hundred human-labeled preference pairs per round to directly optimize prosodic naturalness while regularizing to the current model. On \textbf{KoCC-TTS}, a curated dataset of authentic Korean call center interactions capturing task-oriented dialogues, our method attains the highest human preference (ELO) with competitive CER, outperforming GRPO and strong commercial baselines. These results suggest that when prosody cannot be rewarded automatically, \textit{human preference optimization} offers a practical and data-efficient path to natural and robust TTS.

| **[Bridging the gap between training and inference in LM-based TTS models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17021v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) have shown that language model (LM) based systems offer competitive performance compared to traditional approaches. However, in training, TTS models use ground-truth (GT) tokens as prefixes to predict the next token, while in inference these tokens are not available, a gap between training and inference that is often neglected. In this study, we propose a prompt-guided hybrid training scheme to mitigate exposure bias in popular LM-based TTS systems. Our core idea is to adopt a hybrid training paradigm that combines teacher forcing with free running, thereby introducing self-generated tokens into the training process. This makes the training mode more consistent with inference, reducing the training-inference gap. In addition, we incorporate an EOS prediction mechanism during training to detect incorrect sequence termination and adaptively control the free running process. Experimental results provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of exposure bias on LM-based TTS, and demonstrate that our method effectively narrows the training-inference gap, thereby improving the quality of synthesized long-form speech.</p></details> | 2025-09-21 | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Existing DiT-based text-to-speech (TTS) model acceleration approaches mainly focus on reducing sampling steps through distillation techniques, yet they remain constrained by training costs. We introduce DiTReducio, a training-free acceleration framework that compresses computations in DiT-based TTS models via progressive calibration. We propose two compression methods, Temporal Skipping and Branch Skipping, to eliminate redundant computations during inference. Moreover, based on two characteristic attention patterns identified within DiT layers, we devise a pattern-guided strategy to selectively apply the compression methods. Our method allows flexible modulation between generation quality and computational efficiency through adjustable compression thresholds. Experimental evaluations conducted on F5-TTS and MegaTTS 3 demonstrate that DiTReducio achieves a 75.4% reduction in FLOPs and improves the Real-Time Factor (RTF) by 37.1%, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> | 2025-09-11 |  |

LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.</p></details> | 2025-09-06 |  |

Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.</p></details> | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference (Oral)</p></details> |

We use duration differences between American English tense (longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS. Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer (at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably, listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for these individuals.</p></details> | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop, 2025, Project webpage

However, challenges such as limited data and the lack of fine-grained, adaptive feature selection often hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose MoTAS, a robust framework designed to enhance AD screening efficiency. MoTAS leverages Text-to-Speech (TTS) augmentation to increase data volume and employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to improve multimodal feature selection, jointly enhancing model generalization. The process begins with automatic speech recognition (ASR) to obtain accurate transcriptions. TTS is then used to synthesize speech that enriches the dataset. After extracting acoustic and text embeddings, the MoE mechanism dynamically selects the most informative features, optimizing feature fusion for improved classification. Evaluated on the ADReSSo dataset, MoTAS achieves a leading accuracy of 85.71\%, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of TTS augmentation and MoE in boosting classification performance. These findings highlight the practical value of MoTAS in real-world AD screening scenarios, particularly in data-limited settings.</p></details> | 2025-08-28 |  |
| **[Your Reward Function for RL is Your Best PRM for Search: Unifying RL and Search-Based TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14313v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.</p></details> | 2025-08-22 |  |
| **[VisualSpeech: Enhancing Prosody Modeling in TTS Using Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19258v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis faces the inherent challenge of producing multiple speech outputs with varying prosody given a single text input. While previous research has addressed this by predicting prosodic information from both text and speech, additional contextual information, such as video, remains under-utilized despite being available in many applications. This paper investigates the potential of integrating visual context to enhance prosody prediction. We propose a novel model, VisualSpeech, which incorporates visual and textual information for improving prosody generation in TTS. Empirical results indicate that incorporating visual features improves prosodic modeling, enhancing the expressiveness of the synthesized speech.

However, in real-world applications, the diverse range of user-generated descriptions inevitably introduces numerous out-of-domain inputs that challenge the text understanding capabilities of these systems. To address this issue, we propose MoE-TTS, a description-based TTS model designed to enhance the understanding of out-of-domain text descriptions. MoE-TTS employs a modality-based mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach to augment a pre-trained textual large language model (LLM) with a set of specialized weights adapted to the speech modality while maintaining the original LLM frozen during training. This approach allows MoE-TTS to effectively leverage the pre-trained knowledge and text understanding abilities of textual LLMs. Our experimental results indicate that: first, even the most advanced closed-source commercial products can be challenged by carefully designed out-of-domain description test sets; second, MoE-TTS achieves superior performance in generating speech that more accurately reflects the descriptions.

Recent advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning, facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech technologies.</p></details> | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models struggle with zero-shot transcription of dysarthric speech, yielding high error rates. To improve performance with limited real dysarthric data, we fine-tune an ASR model using synthetic speech generated via a personalized text-to-speech (TTS) system. We introduce a method for generating synthetic dysarthric speech with controlled severity by leveraging premorbidity recordings of the given speaker and speaker embedding interpolation, enabling ASR fine-tuning on a continuum of impairments. Fine-tuning on both real and synthetic dysarthric speech reduces the character error rate (CER) from 36-51% (zero-shot) to 7.3%. Our monolingual FastConformer_Hu ASR model significantly outperforms Whisper-turbo when fine-tuned on the same data, and the inclusion of synthetic speech contributes to an 18% relative CER reduction. These results highlight the potential of personalized ASR systems for improving accessibility for individuals with severe speech impairments.</p></details> | 2025-08-08 |  |

We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing subjective tests.</p></details> | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at InterSpeech 2025</p></details> |

The solution is built for telecom, combining four specialized models by NetoAI: TSLAM, a 4-bit quantized Telecom-Specific Large Language Model (LLM); T-VEC, a Telecom-Specific Embedding Model; TTE, a Telecom-Specific Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model; and T-Synth, a Telecom-Specific Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. These models enable highly responsive, domain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken interactions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE), conversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over telecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for telecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500 human-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent queries. This framework allows analysis of latency, domain relevance, and real-time performance across the stack. Results show that TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth deliver real-time factors (RTF) below 1.0, supporting enterprise, low-latency telecom deployments. These AI agents -- powered by TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth -- provide a foundation for next-generation telecom AI, enabling automated customer support, diagnostics, and more.</p></details> | 2025-08-05 |  |

Our method leverages a diffusion-based TTS architecture, where a speaker encoder extracts embeddings from short reference audio samples to condition the DDPM decoder for multispeaker generation. To further enhance prosody and naturalness, we employ a cross-attention based duration prediction mechanism that utilizes reference audio, enabling more accurate and speaker consistent timing. This results in speech that closely resembles the target speaker while improving duration modeling and overall expressiveness. Additionally, to improve zero-shot generation, we employed classifier free guidance, allowing the system to generate speech more near speech for unknown speakers. Using this approach, we trained language-specific speaker-conditioned models.

In contrast to conventional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | 2025-07-08 |  |

| **[Multi-interaction TTS toward professional recording reproduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00808v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthesized speech. Our approach models the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed model with its corresponding dataset enables iterative style refinements in accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction capability.

While many speaker embeddings have been developed for speaker recognition, their relative effectiveness in zero-shot TTS remains underexplored. In this work, we employ a YourTTS-based TTS system to compare three different speaker encoders - YourTTS's original H/ASP encoder, x-vector embeddings, and ECAPA-TDNN embeddings - within an otherwise fixed zero-shot TTS framework. All models were trained on the same dataset of Czech read speech and evaluated on 24 out-of-domain target speakers using both subjective and objective methods. The subjective evaluation was conducted via a listening test focused on speaker similarity, while the objective evaluation measured cosine distances between speaker embeddings extracted from synthesized and real utterances. Across both evaluations, the original H/ASP encoder consistently outperformed the alternatives, with ECAPA-TDNN showing better results than x-vectors. These findings suggest that, despite the popularity of ECAPA-TDNN in speaker recognition, it does not necessarily offer improvements for speaker similarity in zero-shot TTS in this configuration. Our study highlights the importance of empirical evaluation when reusing speaker recognition embeddings in TTS and provides a framework for additional future comparisons.</p></details> | 2025-06-25 | Accepted to TSD 2025 |

Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with high acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits scalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent studies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they often overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS models to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality yet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a data-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1) automated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic selection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3) evaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean opinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance. Furthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a closed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data cleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model. Extensive experiments on Japanese YouTube data demonstrate that TTSOps outperforms conventional acoustic-quality-based baselines in both the naturalness and speaker diversity of synthesized speech.</p></details> | 2025-06-18 |  |

The process starts with an existing ASR model generating pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings.</p></details> | 2025-06-16 |  |

Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization.

Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model, with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the voice reconstruction task.</p></details> | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

India has 1369 languages, with 22 official using 13 scripts. Training a TTS system for all these languages, most of which have no digital resources, seems a Herculean task. Our work focuses on zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for Sanskrit, Maharashtrian and Canara Konkani, Maithili and Kurukh by leveraging linguistic connections across languages with suitable synthesisers. Evaluations confirm the effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its potential to expand speech technology access for under-represented languages.</p></details> | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |
| **[Counterfactual Activation Editing for Post-hoc Prosody and Mispronunciation Correction in TTS Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00832v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have significantly improved speech naturalness, increasing the demand for precise prosody control and mispronunciation correction. Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often depend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity for post-hoc adjustments. Similarly, traditional mispronunciation correction relies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in low-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation. Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features and corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens the door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining, bridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

VoiceStar is an autoregressive encoder-decoder neural codec language model, that leverages a novel Progress-Monitoring Rotary Position Embedding (PM-RoPE) and is trained with Continuation-Prompt Mixed (CPM) training. PM-RoPE enables the model to better align text and speech tokens, indicates the target duration for the generated speech, and also allows the model to generate speech waveforms much longer in duration than those seen during. CPM training also helps to mitigate the training/inference mismatch, and significantly improves the quality of the generated speech in terms of speaker similarity and intelligibility. VoiceStar outperforms or is on par with current state-of-the-art models on short-form benchmarks such as Librispeech and Seed-TTS, and significantly outperforms these models on long-form/extrapolation benchmarks (20-50s) in terms of intelligibility and naturalness.

Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions. Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation, making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645 diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems, such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval, demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences. Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment and a high correlation with human preferences.

GSA first captures the local style of each semantic sound unit. Then the local styles are combined by self-attention to obtain a global style condition. This semantic and hierarchical encoding strategy provides a robust and rich style representation for an acoustic model. We test GSA-TTS on unseen speakers and obtain promising results regarding naturalness, speaker similarity, and intelligibility. Additionally, we explore the potential of GSA in terms of interpretability and controllability, which stems from its hierarchical structure.</p></details> | 2025-05-26 | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[UniTTS: An end-to-end TTS system without decoupling of acoustic and semantic information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17426v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multi-codebook neutral audio codecs such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) and Group Vector Quantization (GVQ) has significantly advanced Large-Language-Model (LLM) based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. These codecs are crucial in separating semantic and acoustic information while efficiently harnessing semantic priors. However, since semantic and acoustic information cannot be fully aligned, a significant drawback of these methods when applied to LLM-based TTS is that large language models may have limited access to comprehensive audio information. To address this limitation, we propose DistilCodec and UniTTS, which collectively offer the following advantages: 1) This method can distill a multi-codebook audio codec into a single-codebook audio codec with 32,768 codes while achieving a near 100\% utilization. 2) As DistilCodec does not employ a semantic alignment scheme, a large amount of high-quality unlabeled audio (such as audiobooks with sound effects, songs, etc.) can be incorporated during training, further expanding data diversity and broadening its applicability. 3) Leveraging the comprehensive audio information modeling of DistilCodec, we integrated three key tasks into UniTTS's pre-training framework: audio modality autoregression, text modality autoregression, and speech-text cross-modal autoregression. This allows UniTTS to accept interleaved text and speech/audio prompts while substantially preserving LLM's text capabilities. 4) UniTTS employs a three-stage training process: Pre-Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Alignment. Source code and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/IDEA-Emdoor-Lab/UniTTS and https://github.com/IDEA-Emdoor-Lab/DistilCodec.</p></details> | 2025-05-23 |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel neural codec-based speech denoiser and integrate it with the advanced LLM-based TTS model, LauraTTS, to achieve noise-robust zero-shot TTS. The proposed codec denoiser consists of an audio codec, a token denoiser, and an embedding refiner. The token denoiser predicts the first two groups of clean acoustic tokens from the noisy ones, which can serve as the acoustic prompt for LauraTTS to synthesize high-quality personalized speech or be converted to clean speech waveforms through the embedding refiner and codec decoder. Experimental results show that our proposed codec denoiser outperforms state-of-the-art speech enhancement (SE) methods, and the proposed noise-robust LauraTTS surpasses the approach using additional SE models.</p></details> | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional MoE approaches, which face substantial computational overhead as expert counts grow, TT-LoRA MoE decomposes training into two distinct, optimized stages. First, we independently train lightweight, tensorized low-rank adapters (TT-LoRA experts), each specialized for specific tasks. Subsequently, these expert adapters remain frozen, eliminating inter-task interference and catastrophic forgetting in multi-task setting. A sparse MoE router, trained separately, dynamically leverages base model representations to select exactly one specialized adapter per input at inference time, automating expert selection without explicit task specification. Comprehensive experiments confirm our architecture retains the memory efficiency of low-rank adapters, seamlessly scales to large expert pools, and achieves robust task-level optimization. This structured decoupling significantly enhances computational efficiency and flexibility: uses only 2% of LoRA, 0.3% of Adapters and 0.03% of AdapterFusion parameters and outperforms AdapterFusion by 4 value in multi-tasking, enabling practical and scalable multi-task inference deployments.</p></details> | 2025-04-29 |  |

Recent advancements in transformer-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems, such as Fish-Speech, CosyVoice, and MegaTTS 3, have delivered remarkable improvements in quality and realism, driving a significant evolution in the TTS domain. In this paper, we introduce RWKV-7 \cite{peng2025rwkv}, a cutting-edge RNN-based architecture tailored for TTS applications.

SPSS and USEL offer low latency and low disk footprint at the expense of naturalness and audio quality. Cloud-based neural TTS systems provide significantly better audio quality and naturalness but regress in terms of latency and responsiveness, rendering these impractical for real-world applications. More recently, neural TTS models were made deployable to run on handheld devices. Nevertheless, latency remains higher than SPSS and USEL, while disk footprint prohibits pre-installation for multiple voices at once. In this work, we describe a high-quality compact neural TTS system achieving latency on the order of 15 ms with low disk footprint. The proposed solution is capable of running on low-power devices.</p></details> | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

However, current methods for achieving zero-shot TTS heavily rely on large model scales and extensive training datasets to ensure satisfactory performance and generalizability across various speakers. This raises concerns regarding both deployment costs and data security. In this paper, we present a lightweight and stable zero-shot TTS system. We introduce a novel TTS architecture designed to effectively model linguistic content and various speaker attributes from source speech and prompt speech, respectively. Furthermore, we present a two-stage self-distillation framework that constructs parallel data pairs for effectively disentangling linguistic content and speakers from the perspective of training data.

Methods: The effectiveness of these models is evaluated based on listener preferences in subjective tests. Two approaches are explored: (1) a bidirectional LSTM model with task-specific embeddings trained from scratch, and (2) a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on phrase break prediction.

The End-to-End TTS system used comprises a Tacotron2 model with Dynamic Convolutional Attention for mel spectrogram prediction and a WaveRNN vocoder for waveform generation. Results: The listening tests show a clear preference for text synthesized with predicted phrase breaks over text synthesized without them.

In many cases, text sentences may contain segments in different languages, a phenomenon known as code-switching. This is particularly common in Indonesia, especially between Indonesian and English. Despite its significance, no research has yet developed a multilingual TTS system capable of handling code-switching between these two languages. This study addresses Indonesian-English code-switching in STEN-TTS. Key modifications include adding a language identification component to the text-to-phoneme conversion using finetuned BERT for per-word language identification, as well as removing language embedding from the base model. Experimental results demonstrate that the code-switching model achieves superior naturalness and improved speech intelligibility compared to the Indonesian and English baseline STEN-TTS models.</p></details> | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at O-COCOSDA 2024</p></details> |
| **[TouchTTS: An Embarrassingly Simple TTS Framework that Everyone Can Touch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08237v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that LLM-based systems are data-hungry. Recent LLM-based TTS works typically employ complex data processing pipelines to obtain high-quality training data. These sophisticated pipelines require excellent models at each stage (e.g., speech denoising, speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and punctuation models), which themselves demand high-quality training data and are rarely open-sourced. Even with state-of-the-art models, issues persist, such as incomplete background noise removal and misalignment between punctuation and actual speech pauses. Moreover, the stringent filtering strategies often retain only 10-30\% of the original data, significantly impeding data scaling efforts. In this work, we leverage a noise-robust audio tokenizer (S3Tokenizer) to design a simplified yet effective TTS data processing pipeline that maintains data quality while substantially reducing data acquisition costs, achieving a data retention rate of over 50\%. Beyond data scaling challenges, LLM-based TTS systems also incur higher deployment costs compared to conventional approaches. Current systems typically use LLMs solely for text-to-token generation, while requiring separate models (e.g., flow matching models) for token-to-waveform generation, which cannot be directly executed by LLM inference engines, further complicating deployment. To address these challenges, we eliminate redundant modules in both LLM and flow components, replacing the flow model backbone with an LLM architecture. Building upon this simplified flow backbone, we propose a unified architecture for both streaming and non-streaming inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Finally, we explore the feasibility of unifying TTS and ASR tasks using the same data for training, thanks to the simplified pipeline and the S3Tokenizer that reduces the quality requirements for TTS training data.</p></details> | 2024-12-12 | Technical Report |

Existing research primarily utilizes additional text data and predefined speech styles supported by TTS models. In this paper, we propose Hard-Synth, a novel ASR data augmentation method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and advanced zero-shot TTS. Our approach employs LLMs to generate diverse in-domain text through rewriting, without relying on additional text data. Rather than using predefined speech styles, we introduce a hard prompt selection method with zero-shot TTS to clone speech styles that the ASR model finds challenging to recognize. Experiments demonstrate that Hard-Synth significantly enhances the Conformer model, achieving relative word error rate (WER) reductions of 6.5\%/4.4\% on LibriSpeech dev/test-other subsets. Additionally, we show that Hard-Synth is data-efficient and capable of reducing bias in ASR.</p></details> | 2024-11-20 |  |

They also showed that co-TT graphs are equivalent to symmetric signed-interval digraphs, where some vertices of the digraphs have loops and others do not. We have showed that this actually solve the representation characterization problem of co-TT graphs posed by Monma, Reed and Trotter [24]. In this paper, we characterize signed-interval bigraphs and signed-interval graphs in terms of their biadjacency matrices and adjacency matrices, respectively. Moreover we emphasize on the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, i.e. co-TT graphs. Finally, by utilizing the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, we resolve the open problem of characterizing co-TT graphs in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs, a problem initially posed by Monma, Reed, and Trotter in the same paper.</p></details> | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2206.05917</p></details> |

By leveraging discrete semantic units with higher phonetic correlation obtained from a self-supervised model, our method addresses the inherent instability often encountered in TTS systems, especially those dealing with non-diacriticized scripts like Hebrew. Utilizing HuBERT codes, our model generates discrete representations that are optimized for TTS tasks, thereby reducing the dependency on diacritic-based text processing. This advancement not only simplifies the language modeling process but also improves the robustness and shows controllability of the speech output due to disentenglement properties of the semantic units. The inclusion of a speaker embedding in the vocoder further aids in capturing the unique vocal characteristics of the speaker, contributing to the naturalness of the synthesized speech. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only maintains high performance in Hebrew but also shows adaptability to English, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing stability in TTS systems universally. Our method, named LOTHM (Language of The Hebrew Man), outperforms existing methods in terms of stability while achieving naturalness and speaker similarity on par with previous methods, making it a compelling choice for future speech synthesis applications.

Second, we utilize low-quality Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) data recorded in non-studio environments, which is refined using denoising and speech enhancement models. Third, we apply knowledge distillation from large-scale models using synthetic data to generate more robust outputs. Our experiments with Hindi demonstrate significant reductions in intelligibility issues, as validated by human evaluators.

Comprehensive experiments on an unprecedentedly rich variety of low-resource datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial performance improvements, proving that the proposed method of enhancing low-resource ASR through a versatile TTS model is highly effective and has broad application prospects. Furthermore, we delve deeper into key characteristics of synthesized speech data that contribute to ASR improvement, examining factors such as text diversity, speaker diversity, and the volume of synthesized data, with text diversity being studied for the first time in this work.

However, such data is scarce for Indian languages due to the lack of high-quality, manually subtitled data on platforms like LibriVox or YouTube. To address this gap, we enhance existing large-scale ASR datasets containing natural conversations collected in low-quality environments to generate high-quality TTS training data. Our pipeline leverages the cross-lingual generalization of denoising and speech enhancement models trained on English and applied to Indian languages. This results in IndicVoices-R (IV-R), the largest multilingual Indian TTS dataset derived from an ASR dataset, with 1,704 hours of high-quality speech from 10,496 speakers across 22 Indian languages. IV-R matches the quality of gold-standard TTS datasets like LJSpeech, LibriTTS, and IndicTTS. We also introduce the IV-R Benchmark, the first to assess zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot speaker generalization capabilities of TTS models on Indian voices, ensuring diversity in age, gender, and style. We demonstrate that fine-tuning an English pre-trained model on a combined dataset of high-quality IndicTTS and our IV-R dataset results in better zero-shot speaker generalization compared to fine-tuning on the IndicTTS dataset alone. Further, our evaluation reveals limited zero-shot generalization for Indian voices in TTS models trained on prior datasets, which we improve by fine-tuning the model on our data containing diverse set of speakers across language families.

| **[Unsupervised TTS Acoustic Modeling for TTS with Conditional Disentangled Sequential VAE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02512v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised text-to-speech acoustic model training scheme, named UTTS, which does not require text-audio pairs. UTTS is a multi-speaker speech synthesizer that supports zero-shot voice cloning, it is developed from a perspective of disentangled speech representation learning. The framework offers a flexible choice of a speaker's duration model, timbre feature (identity) and content for TTS inference. We leverage recent advancements in self-supervised speech representation learning as well as speech synthesis front-end techniques for system development. Specifically, we employ our recently formulated Conditional Disentangled Sequential Variational Auto-encoder (C-DSVAE) as the backbone UTTS AM, which offers well-structured content representations given unsupervised alignment (UA) as condition during training. For UTTS inference, we utilize a lexicon to map input text to the phoneme sequence, which is expanded to the frame-level forced alignment (FA) with a speaker-dependent duration model. Then, we develop an alignment mapping module that converts FA to UA. Finally, the C-DSVAE, serving as the self-supervised TTS AM, takes the predicted UA and a target speaker embedding to generate the mel spectrogram, which is ultimately converted to waveform with a neural vocoder.

| **[HaTT: Hadamard avoiding TT recompression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04385v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hadamard product of tensor train (TT) tensors is one of the most fundamental nonlinear operations in scientific computing and data analysis. Due to its tendency to significantly increase TT ranks, the Hadamard product presents a major computational challenge in TT tensor-based algorithms. Therefore, it is essential to develop recompression algorithms that mitigate the effects of this rank increase. Existing recompression algorithms require an explicit representation of the Hadamard product, resulting in high computational and storage complexity. In this work, we propose the Hadamard avoiding TT recompression (HaTT) algorithm. Leveraging the structure of the Hadamard product in TT tensors and its Hadamard product-free property, the overall complexity of the HaTT algorithm is significantly lower than that of existing TT recompression algorithms. This is validated through complexity analysis and several numerical experiments.</p></details> | 2024-10-06 | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Exploring synthetic data for cross-speaker style transfer in style representation based TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17364v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating cross-speaker style transfer in text-to-speech (TTS) models is challenging due to the need to disentangle speaker and style information in audio. In low-resource expressive data scenarios, voice conversion (VC) can generate expressive speech for target speakers, which can then be used to train the TTS model. However, the quality and style transfer ability of the VC model are crucial for the overall TTS model quality. In this work, we explore the use of synthetic data generated by a VC model to assist the TTS model in cross-speaker style transfer tasks. Additionally, we employ pre-training of the style encoder using timbre perturbation and prototypical angular loss to mitigate speaker leakage. Our results show that using VC synthetic data can improve the naturalness and speaker similarity of TTS in cross-speaker scenarios. Furthermore, we extend this approach to a cross-language scenario, enhancing accent transfer.</p></details> | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SynData4GenAI 2024</p></details> |

Leveraging deep learning, FEIM-TTS transcends traditional TTS systems by interpreting facial cues and adjusting to emotional nuances without dependence on labeled datasets. To address sparse audio-visual-emotional data, the model is trained using LRS3, CREMA-D, and MELD datasets, demonstrating its adaptability. FEIM-TTS's unique capability to produce high-quality, speaker-agnostic speech makes it suitable for creating adaptable voices for virtual characters. Moreover, FEIM-TTS significantly enhances accessibility for individuals with visual impairments or those who have trouble seeing. By integrating emotional nuances into TTS, our model enables dynamic and engaging auditory experiences for webcomics, allowing visually impaired users to enjoy these narratives more fully. Comprehensive evaluation evidences its proficiency in modulating emotion and intensity, advancing emotional speech synthesis and accessibility.

We propose a general front-end encoder as a compact and effective module to utilize multimodal inputs including text prompts, audio references, and speaker timbre references in a fully zero-shot manner and produce disentangled style and speaker control embeddings. Our novel approach also leverages a hierarchical conformer structure for the fusion of style and speaker control embeddings, aiming to achieve optimal feature fusion within the current advanced TTS architecture. StyleFusion-TTS is evaluated through multiple metrics, both subjectively and objectively.

Our proposed VT module comprises a speaker-encoder that processes reference speech, a bottleneck layer, and residual adapters, connected to preexisting TTS layers. We compare the performance of various configurations of these components and report Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Speaker Similarity across languages. Using a single English reference speech per speaker, we achieve an average voice transfer similarity score of 73% across nine target languages. Vocal characteristics contribute significantly to the construction and perception of individual identity. The loss of one's voice, due to physical or neurological conditions, can lead to a profound sense of loss, impacting one's core identity. As a case study, we demonstrate that our approach can not only transfer typical speech but also restore the voices of individuals with dysarthria, even when only atypical speech samples are available - a valuable utility for those who have never had typical speech or banked their voice. Cross-lingual typical audio samples, plus videos demonstrating voice restoration for dysarthric speakers are available here (google.github.io/tacotron/publications/zero_shot_voice_transfer).</p></details> | 2024-09-20 | Submitted to ICASSP |

Further optimization can be achieved through preference alignment algorithms, which adjust LMs to align with the preferences of reward models, enhancing the desirability of the generated content. This study presents a thorough empirical evaluation of how preference alignment algorithms, particularly Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enhance LM-based TTS. With a 1.15B parameter LM-based TTS model, we demonstrate that preference alignment consistently improves intelligibility, speaker similarity, and proxy subjective evaluation scores, with the latter two metrics surpassing even human speech in certain evaluations. We also show preference alignment is applicable to low-resource scenarios and effectively generalized to out-of-domain applications.</p></details> | 2024-09-19 |  |
| **[Towards Developing State-of-the-Art TTS Synthesisers for 13 Indian Languages with Signal Processing aided Alignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17153v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end (E2E) systems synthesise high-quality speech, but this typically requires a large amount of data. As E2E synthesis progressed from Tacotron to FastSpeech2, it became evident that features representing prosody, particularly sub-word durations, are important for error-free synthesis. Variants of FastSpeech use a teacher model or forced alignments for training. This paper uses signal processing cues in tandem with forced alignment to produce accurate phone boundaries for the training data. As a result of better duration modelling, good-quality synthesisers are developed. Evaluations indicate that systems developed using the proposed signal processing-aided approach are better than systems developed using other alignment approaches, especially in low-resource scenarios. Our systems also outperform the existing best TTS systems available for 13 Indian languages.</p></details> | 2024-09-18 | Version 1 uploaded |

Our proposed model improves speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity compared to a single-stage baseline. Although two-stage systems still lead in intelligibility, our model significantly narrows the gap while delivering comparable speech quality.

The training of E1 TTS is straightforward; it does not require explicit monotonic alignment between the text and audio pairs.

In the E2 TTS framework, the text input is converted into a character sequence with filler tokens. The flow-matching-based mel spectrogram generator is then trained based on the audio infilling task. Unlike many previous works, it does not require additional components (e.g., duration model, grapheme-to-phoneme) or complex techniques (e.g., monotonic alignment search). Despite its simplicity, E2 TTS achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS capabilities that are comparable to or surpass previous works, including Voicebox and NaturalSpeech 3. The simplicity of E2 TTS also allows for flexibility in the input representation. We propose several variants of E2 TTS to improve usability during inference.

ManaTTS, released under the open CC-0 license, comprises approximately 86 hours of audio with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. Alongside ManaTTS, we also generated the VirgoolInformal dataset to evaluate Persian speech recognition models used for forced alignment, extending over 5 hours of audio. The datasets are supported by a fully transparent, MIT-licensed pipeline, a testament to innovation in the field. It includes unique tools for sentence tokenization, bounded audio segmentation, and a novel forced alignment method. This alignment technique is specifically designed for low-resource languages, addressing a crucial need in the field. With this dataset, we trained a Tacotron2-based TTS model, achieving a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 3.76, which is remarkably close to the MOS of 3.86 for the utterances generated by the same vocoder and natural spectrogram, and the MOS of 4.01 for the natural waveform, demonstrating the exceptional quality and effectiveness of the corpus.</p></details> | 2024-09-11 | 33 pages, 12 figures |

By leveraging advanced speech processing techniques, we compare TTS-generated audio with human-recorded speech to analyze differences in pitch, duration, and energy. Key features are extracted using tools like PyWorld and Librosa, which are then adjusted to align with the prosodic characteristics of natural human speech. The modified features undergo synthesis, producing enhanced TTS outputs that more closely mirror the natural prosody of human speech. This approach aims to enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of TTS systems by providing a framework for precise prosodic parameter adjustments. Our methodology involves feature extraction, prosodic manipulation, and synthesis, followed by comprehensive evaluations to ensure consistency with human speech patterns. The findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of prosodic parameter manipulation for controlled speech generation, highlighting its potential to significantly improve TTS applications.</p></details> | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Summer School on NLP 2024 at IIIT

To address this challenge, we present a novel augmentation technique for training universal vocoders. Our training scheme randomly applies linear smoothing filters to input acoustic features, facilitating vocoder generalization across a wide range of smoothings. It significantly mitigates the training-inference mismatch, enhancing the naturalness of synthetic output even when the acoustic model produces overly smoothed features. Notably, our method is applicable to any vocoder without requiring architectural modifications or dependencies on specific acoustic models. The experimental results validate the superiority of our vocoder over conventional methods, achieving 11.99% and 12.05% improvements in mean opinion scores when integrated with Tacotron 2 and FastSpeech 2 TTS acoustic models, respectively.</p></details> | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures, for demo samples, see

| **[Adversarial training of Keyword Spotting to Minimize TTS Data Overfitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10463v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The keyword spotting (KWS) problem requires large amounts of real speech training data to achieve high accuracy across diverse populations. Utilizing large amounts of text-to-speech (TTS) synthesized data can reduce the cost and time associated with KWS development. However, TTS data may contain artifacts not present in real speech, which the KWS model can exploit (overfit), leading to degraded accuracy on real speech. To address this issue, we propose applying an adversarial training method to prevent the KWS model from learning TTS-specific features when trained on large amounts of TTS data. Experimental results demonstrate that KWS model accuracy on real speech data can be improved by up to 12% when adversarial loss is used in addition to the original KWS loss. Surprisingly, we also observed that the adversarial setup improves accuracy by up to 8%, even when trained solely on TTS and real negative speech data, without any real positive examples.</p></details> | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in a Workshop at Interspeech 2024, Synthetic Data's

| **[Tensor Train Low-rank Approximation (TT-LoRA): Democratizing AI with Accelerated LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01008v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as question-answering, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and machine translation. However, the ever-growing complexity of LLMs demands immense computational resources, hindering the broader research and application of these models. To address this, various parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, such as Low-Rank Approximation (LoRA) and Adapters, have been developed. Despite their potential, these methods often face limitations in compressibility. Specifically, LoRA struggles to scale effectively with the increasing number of trainable parameters in modern large scale LLMs. Additionally, Low-Rank Economic Tensor-Train Adaptation (LoRETTA), which utilizes tensor train decomposition, has not yet achieved the level of compression necessary for fine-tuning very large scale models with limited resources. This paper introduces Tensor Train Low-Rank Approximation (TT-LoRA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach that extends LoRETTA with optimized tensor train (TT) decomposition integration. By eliminating Adapters and traditional LoRA-based structures, TT-LoRA achieves greater model compression without compromising downstream task performance, along with reduced inference latency and computational overhead. We conduct an exhaustive parameter search to establish benchmarks that highlight the trade-off between model compression and performance. Our results demonstrate significant compression of LLMs while maintaining comparable performance to larger models, facilitating their deployment on resource-constraint platforms.</p></details> | 2024-08-02 | LA-UR-24-28177 |
| **[Utilizing TTS Synthesized Data for Efficient Development of Keyword Spotting Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18879v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the use of TTS synthesized training data for KWS (keyword spotting) task while minimizing development cost and time. Keyword spotting models require a huge amount of training data to be accurate, and obtaining such training data can be costly. In the current state of the art, TTS models can generate large amounts of natural-sounding data, which can help reducing cost and time for KWS model development. Still, TTS generated data can be lacking diversity compared to real data. To pursue maximizing KWS model accuracy under the constraint of limited resources and current TTS capability, we explored various strategies to mix TTS data and real human speech data, with a focus on minimizing real data use and maximizing diversity of TTS output. Our experimental results indicate that relatively small amounts of real audio data with speaker diversity (100 speakers, 2k utterances) and large amounts of TTS synthesized data can achieve reasonably high accuracy (within 3x error rate of baseline), compared to the baseline (trained with 3.8M real positive utterances).</p></details> | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in a Workshop at Interspeech 2024, Synthetic Data's

This limitation becomes evident in downstream applications where domain-specific vocabulary coupled with frequent code-mixing with English, results in many OOV words. To highlight this problem, we create a benchmark containing OOV words from several real-world applications. Indeed, state-of-the-art Hindi and Tamil TTS systems perform poorly on this OOV benchmark, as indicated by intelligibility tests. To improve the model's OOV performance, we propose a low-effort and economically viable strategy to obtain more training data. Specifically, we propose using volunteers as opposed to high quality voice artists to record words containing character bigrams unseen in the training data. We show that using such inexpensive data, the model's performance improves on OOV words, while not affecting voice quality and in-domain performance.</p></details> | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |

Traditional Hebrew contains Diacritics, which dictate the way individuals should pronounce given words, however, modern Hebrew rarely uses them. The lack of diacritics in modern Hebrew results in readers expected to conclude the correct pronunciation and understand which phonemes to use based on the context. This imposes a fundamental challenge on TTS systems to accurately map between text-to-speech. In this work, we propose to adopt a language modeling Diacritics-Free approach, for the task of Hebrew TTS. The model operates on discrete speech representations and is conditioned on a word-piece tokenizer. We optimize the proposed method using in-the-wild weakly supervised data and compare it to several diacritic-based TTS systems. Results suggest the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines considering both content preservation and naturalness of the generated speech.

To shorten the sequence length of speech tokens, acoustic byte-pair encoding (BPE) has emerged in SLM that treats speech tokens from self-supervised semantic representations as characters to further compress the token sequence. But the gain in TTS has not been fully investigated, and the proper choice of acoustic BPE remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on various settings of acoustic BPE to explore its effectiveness in decoder-only TTS models with semantic speech tokens. Experiments on LibriTTS verify that acoustic BPE uniformly increases the intelligibility and diversity of synthesized speech, while showing different features across BPE settings. Hence, acoustic BPE is a favorable tool for decoder-only TTS.</p></details> | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 tables, 1 figures. accepted to Interspeech 2024</p></details> |

It is possible to utilise ASVs in isolation or in conjunction with other AI models. In the contemporary era, the quality and quantity of neural networks are increasing exponentially. Concurrently, there is a growing number of systems that aim to manipulate data through the use of voice conversion and text-to-speech models. The field of voice biometrics forgery is aided by a number of challenges, including SSTC, ASVSpoof, and SingFake. This paper presents a system for automatic speaker verification. The primary objective of our model is the extraction of embeddings from the target speaker's audio in order to obtain information about important characteristics of his voice, such as pitch, energy, and the duration of phonemes. This information is used in our multivoice TTS pipeline, which is currently under development.

Existing metrics used for AQA such as BLEU, METEOR and BERTScore, mostly adapted from NLP and audio captioning, rely on surface similarity and fail to account for question context, reasoning, and partial correctness. To address the gap in literature, we make three contributions in this work. First, we introduce AQEval to enable systematic benchmarking of AQA metrics. It is the first benchmark of its kind, consisting of 10k model responses annotated by multiple humans for their correctness and relevance. Second, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing AQA metrics on AQEval, highlighting weak correlation with human judgment, especially for longer answers. Third, we propose a new metric - AURA score, to better evaluate open-ended model responses. On AQEval, AURA achieves state-of-the-art correlation with human ratings, significantly outperforming all baselines. Through this work, we aim to highlight the limitations of current AQA evaluation methods and motivate better metrics. We release both the AQEval benchmark and the AURA metric to support future research in holistic AQA evaluation.</p></details> | 2025-10-06 |  |

Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer, which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust ``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information, achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions, offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints will be publicly released.</p></details> | 2025-10-03 |  |

Unlike conventional discriminative features that directly optimize posterior and thus emphasize semantic abstraction while losing fine grained details, audio generation models inherently encode both spatiotemporal perception (capturing local acoustic texture across time and frequency) and semantic prior (knowing what to generate). It motivates us to explore the bridge of these complementary strengths. We provide a systematic investigation of their differences and complementary relationships, and ultimately propose an effective fusion strategy. Experiments across multiple tasks, including sound event classification, tagging, and particularly the fine grained task of audio captioning, demonstrate consistent performance gains. Beyond empirical improvements, this work more importantly introduces a new perspective on audio representation learning, highlighting that generative discriminative complementarity can provide both detailed perception and semantic awareness for audio understanding.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 |  |

However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles.

| **[From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01659v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.</p></details> | 2025-09-22 |  |
| **[Qwen3-Omni Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17765v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Qwen3-Omni, a single multimodal model that, for the first time, maintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video without any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech generation in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p></details> | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Omni</p></details> |

Most research focuses on training an adapter layer to generate a unified audio feature for the LLM. However, different tasks may require distinct features that emphasize either semantic or acoustic aspects, making task-specific audio features more desirable. In this paper, we propose Prompt-aware Mixture (PaM) to enhance the Speech LLM that uses multiple audio encoders. Our approach involves using different experts to extract different features based on the prompt that indicates different tasks. Experiments demonstrate that with PaM, only one Speech LLM surpasses the best performances achieved by all single-encoder Speech LLMs on ASR, Speaker Number Verification, and AC tasks. PaM also outperforms other feature fusion baselines, such as concatenation and averaging.

To address this limitation, we propose a preference-aligned audio captioning framework based on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). To effectively capture nuanced human preferences, we train a Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP)-based reward model using human-labeled pairwise preference data. This reward model is integrated into a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune any baseline captioning system without relying on ground-truth caption annotations. Extensive human evaluations across multiple datasets show that our method produces captions preferred over those from baseline models, particularly in cases where the baseline models fail to provide correct and natural captions. Furthermore, our framework achieves performance comparable to supervised approaches with ground-truth data, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning audio captioning with human preferences and its scalability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

To overcome this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models, eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt, which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no keyword list is used.</p></details> | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The 26th International Conference on Web Information

However, for machines, accessing a large-scale dataset covering diverse aspects of music is crucial, yet challenging, due to the scarcity of publicly available music data of this type. This paper introduces MQAD, a music QA dataset built on the Million Song Dataset (MSD), encompassing a rich array of musical features, including beat, chord, key, structure, instrument, and genre -- across 270,000 tracks, featuring nearly 3 million diverse questions and captions. MQAD distinguishes itself by offering detailed time-varying musical information such as chords and sections, enabling exploration into the inherent structure of music within a song. To compile MQAD, our methodology leverages specialized Music Information Retrieval (MIR) models to extract higher-level musical features and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate natural language QA pairs. Then, we leverage a multimodal LLM that integrates the LLaMA2 and Whisper architectures, along with novel subjective metrics to assess the performance of MQAD. In experiments, our model trained on MQAD demonstrates advancements over conventional music audio captioning approaches. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/oyzh888/MQAD.</p></details> | 2025-08-27 |  |
| **[Soundscape Captioning using Sound Affective Quality Network and Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05914v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We live in a rich and varied acoustic world, which is experienced by individuals or communities as a soundscape. Computational auditory scene analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events, focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal characteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the affective soundscape captioning (ASSC) task, which enables automated soundscape analysis, thus avoiding labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in conventional methods. With soundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions are generated for soundscape by capturing the acoustic scenes (ASs), audio events (AEs) information, and the corresponding human affective qualities (AQs). To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) system composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet, and a large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about ASs, AEs, and perceived AQs, while the LLM describes the soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with SoundAQnet. SoundSCaper is assessed by two juries of 32 people. In expert evaluation, the average score of SoundSCaper-generated captions is slightly lower than that of two soundscape experts on the evaluation set D1 and the external mixed dataset D2, but not statistically significant. In layperson evaluation, SoundSCaper outperforms soundscape experts in several metrics. In addition to human evaluation, compared to other automated audio captioning systems with and without LLM, SoundSCaper performs better on the ASSC task in several NLP-based metrics. Overall, SoundSCaper performs well in human subjective evaluation and various objective captioning metrics, and the generated captions are comparable to those annotated by soundscape experts.</p></details> | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, Code:

In parallel, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, offering improved controllability, bidirectional context modeling, and robust generation. However, their application to the audio modality remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DIFFA}, the first diffusion-based large audio-language model designed to perform spoken language understanding. DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion language model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech understanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training pipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then, learning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs automatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960 hours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates competitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and VoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our results reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient and scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI.

| **[CLAIR-A: Leveraging Large Language Models to Judge Audio Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12962v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) task asks models to generate natural language descriptions of an audio input. Evaluating these machine-generated audio captions is a complex task that requires considering diverse factors, among them, auditory scene understanding, sound-object inference, temporal coherence, and the environmental context of the scene. While current methods focus on specific aspects, they often fail to provide an overall score that aligns well with human judgment. In this work, we propose CLAIR-A, a simple and flexible method that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate audio captions by directly asking LLMs for a semantic distance score. In our evaluations, CLAIR-A better predicts human judgements of quality compared to traditional metrics, with a 5.8% relative accuracy improvement compared to the domain-specific FENSE metric and up to 11% over the best general-purpose measure on the Clotho-Eval dataset. Moreover, CLAIR-A offers more transparency by allowing the language model to explain the reasoning behind its scores, with these explanations rated up to 30% better by human evaluators than those provided by baseline methods.

Yet these tasks remain largely constrained to surface-level recognition-capturing what happened but not why, what it implies, or how it unfolds in context. I propose a conceptual reframing of auditory intelligence as a layered, situated process that encompasses perception, reasoning, and interaction. To instantiate this view, I introduce four cognitively inspired task paradigms-ASPIRE, SODA, AUX, and AUGMENT-those structure auditory understanding across time-frequency pattern captioning, hierarchical event/scene description, causal explanation, and goal-driven interpretation, respectively. Together, these paradigms provide a roadmap toward more generalizable, explainable, and human-aligned auditory intelligence, and are intended to catalyze a broader discussion of what it means for machines to understand sound.</p></details> | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Posit...</summary><p>Position paper without experimental/quantitative validation.

This paper introduces MiDashengLM, a novel open audio-language model designed for efficient and comprehensive audio understanding through the use of general audio captions using our novel ACAVCaps training dataset. MiDashengLM exclusively relies on publicly available pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility. At its core, MiDashengLM integrates Dasheng, an open-source audio encoder, specifically engineered to process diverse auditory information effectively. Unlike previous works primarily focused on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based audio-text alignment, our strategy centers on general audio captions, fusing speech, sound and music information into one textual representation, enabling a holistic textual representation of complex audio scenes. Lastly, MiDashengLM provides an up to 4x speedup in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT) and up to 20x higher throughput than comparable models.

While recent advances in multi-modal encoders have enabled progress in cross-modal generation, ambiguity stemming from homographs and auditory illusions continues to hinder accurate alignment. To address this issue, CatchPhrase generates enriched cross-modal semantic prompts (EXPrompt Mining) from weak class labels by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and audio captioning models (ACMs). To address both class-level and instance-level misalignment, we apply multi-modal filtering and retrieval to select the most semantically aligned prompt for each audio sample (EXPrompt Selector). A lightweight mapping network is then trained to adapt pre-trained text-to-image generation models to audio input. Extensive experiments on multiple audio classification datasets demonstrate that CatchPhrase improves audio-to-image alignment and consistently enhances generation quality by mitigating semantic misalignment.</p></details> | 2025-07-24 |  |

Traditional language modeling is an intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple futures may be equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying Multiple Choice Learning to Language Modeling, assuming the data is generated from a mixture of distributions. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use data sampled from mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with extensive experiments on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks that our method achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs.</p></details> | 2025-07-14 |  |

For example, slow, melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g. MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI), which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA.

This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.</p></details> | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to AIMC 2025</p></details> |

This approach aligns the query modality with the audio-text structure of the knowledge base, leading to more effective retrieval.

Drawing inspiration from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2) FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with superior audio-text alignment and instruction following.

Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity. The success of DAC illustrates that text generation can also be seamlessly integrated with audio and visual generation tasks using a diffusion backbone, paving the way for a unified, audio-related generative model across different modalities.</p></details> | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/diffusion-audio-captioning</p></details> |

To enhance performance, an AAC method, EnCLAP, employed discrete tokens from EnCodec as an effective input for fine-tuning a language model BART. However, EnCodec is designed to reconstruct waveforms rather than capture the semantic contexts of general sounds, which AAC should describe. To address this issue, we propose CLAP-ART, an AAC method that utilizes ``semantic-rich and discrete'' tokens as input. CLAP-ART computes semantic-rich discrete tokens from pre-trained audio representations through vector quantization. We experimentally confirmed that CLAP-ART outperforms baseline EnCLAP on two AAC benchmarks, indicating that semantic-rich discrete tokens derived from semantically rich AR are beneficial for AAC.</p></details> | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech2025</p></details> |

Existing methods for this task rely on satellite image and paired geotagged audio samples, which often fail to capture the diversity of sound sources at a given location. To address this limitation, we enhance existing datasets by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate semantically rich soundscape descriptions for locations depicted in satellite images. Our approach incorporates contrastive learning across audio, audio captions, satellite images, and satellite image captions. We hypothesize that there is a fixed set of soundscape concepts shared across modalities. To this end, we learn a shared codebook of soundscape concepts and represent each sample as a weighted average of these concepts. Sat2Sound achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval between satellite image and audio on two datasets: GeoSound and SoundingEarth. Additionally, building on Sat2Sound's ability to retrieve detailed soundscape captions, we introduce a novel application: location-based soundscape synthesis, which enables immersive acoustic experiences.

MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios, including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers: Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding. Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models (OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models. We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but little-explored area.</p></details> | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Open-...</summary><p>Open-source at https://github.com/ddlBoJack/MMAR</p></details> |

Existing contrastive language-audio pretrained models are typically trained using global, clip-level descriptions, which provide only weak temporal supervision. We hypothesize that CLAP-like language-audio models - particularly, if they are expected to produce frame-level embeddings - can benefit from a stronger temporal supervision. To confirm our hypothesis, we curate a novel dataset of approximately 12,000 audio recordings from Freesound, each annotated with single-sentence free-text descriptions linked to a specific temporal segment in an audio recording. We use large language models to clean these annotations by removing references to non-audible events, transcribed speech, typos, and annotator language bias. We further propose a frame-wise contrastive training strategy that learns to align text descriptions with temporal regions in an audio recording and demonstrate that our model has better temporal text-audio alignment abilities compared to models trained only on global captions when evaluated on the AudioSet Strong benchmark. The dataset and our source code are available on Zenodo and GitHub, respectively.</p></details> | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing

In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture.

| **[Taming Data and Transformers for Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19388v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalability of ambient sound generators is hindered by data scarcity, insufficient caption quality, and limited scalability in model architecture. This work addresses these challenges by advancing both data and model scaling. First, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset collection pipeline tailored for ambient audio generation, resulting in AutoReCap-XL, the largest ambient audio-text dataset with over 47 million clips. To provide high-quality textual annotations, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality automatic audio captioning model. By adopting a Q-Former module and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of $83.2$, a $3.2\%$ improvement over previous captioning models. Finally, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. We demonstrate its benefits from data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to baseline audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of $4.7\%$ in FAD score, $11.1\%$ in IS, and $13.5\%$ in CLAP score. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://snap-research.github.io/GenAU/</p></details> |

Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.</p></details> | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Language-Queried Target Sound Extraction Without Parallel Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09398v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a parallel-data-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla parallel-data-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding, while during testing, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder as the condition embedding. This vanilla approach assumes perfect alignment between text and audio embeddings, which is unrealistic. Two major challenges arise from training-testing mismatch: the persistent modality gap between text and audio and the risk of overfitting due to the exposure of rich acoustic details in target audio embedding during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and testing and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.</p></details> | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing models primarily focus on analyzing input signals using text instructions, overlooking scenarios in which speech instructions and audio are mixed and serve as inputs to the model. To address these challenges, we introduce Solla, a novel framework designed to understand speech-based questions and hear the acoustic context concurrently. Solla incorporates an audio tagging module to effectively identify and represent audio events, as well as an ASR-assisted prediction method to improve comprehension of spoken content. To rigorously evaluate Solla and other publicly available models, we propose a new benchmark dataset called SA-Eval, which includes three tasks: audio event classification, audio captioning, and audio question answering. SA-Eval has diverse speech instruction with various speaking styles, encompassing two difficulty levels, easy and hard, to capture the range of real-world acoustic conditions. Experimental results show that Solla performs on par with or outperforms baseline models on both the easy and hard test sets, underscoring its effectiveness in jointly understanding speech and audio.</p></details> | 2025-03-19 |  |

However, current methods often fail to effectively fuse audio and visual data, missing important semantic cues from each modality. To address this, we introduce LAVCap, a large language model (LLM)-based audio-visual captioning framework that effectively integrates visual information with audio to improve audio captioning performance. LAVCap employs an optimal transport-based alignment loss to bridge the modality gap between audio and visual features, enabling more effective semantic extraction. Additionally, we propose an optimal transport attention module that enhances audio-visual fusion using an optimal transport assignment map. Combined with the optimal training strategy, experimental results demonstrate that each component of our framework is effective. LAVCap outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the AudioCaps dataset, without relying on large datasets or post-processing.

Our goal is to improve audio classification accuracy with limited labeled data. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which apply artificial transformations (e.g., adding random noise or masking segments), struggle to create data that captures the true diversity present in real-world audios. To address this shortcoming, we propose to augment the dataset with synthetic audio generated from text-to-audio (T2A) diffusion models. However, synthesizing effective augmentations is challenging because not only should the generated data be acoustically consistent with the underlying small-scale dataset, but they should also have sufficient compositional diversity. To overcome the first challenge, we align the generations of the T2A model with the small-scale dataset using preference optimization. This ensures that the acoustic characteristics of the generated data remain consistent with the small-scale dataset. To address the second challenge, we propose a novel caption generation technique that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models to (1) generate diverse and meaningful audio captions and (2) iteratively refine their quality. The generated captions are then used to prompt the aligned T2A model. We extensively evaluate Synthio on ten datasets and four simulated limited-data settings. Results indicate our method consistently outperforms all baselines by 0.1%-39% using a T2A model trained only on weakly-captioned AudioSet.</p></details> | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

Typically, reasoning performance correlates with model size, with the best results achieved by models exceeding 8 billion parameters. However, no prior work has explored enabling small audio-language models to perform reasoning tasks, despite the potential applications for edge devices. To address this gap, we introduce Mellow, a small Audio-Language Model specifically designed for reasoning. Mellow achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing small audio-language models and surpasses several larger models in reasoning capabilities. For instance, Mellow scores 52.11 on MMAU, comparable to SoTA Qwen2 Audio (which scores 52.5) while using 50 times fewer parameters and being trained on 60 times less data (audio hrs). To train Mellow, we introduce ReasonAQA, a dataset designed to enhance audio-grounded reasoning in models. It consists of a mixture of existing datasets (30% of the data) and synthetically generated data (70%). The synthetic dataset is derived from audio captioning datasets, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate detailed and multiple-choice questions focusing on audio events, objects, acoustic scenes, signal properties, semantics, and listener emotions. To evaluate Mellow's reasoning ability, we benchmark it on a diverse set of tasks, assessing on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, including audio understanding, deductive reasoning, and comparative reasoning. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of projection layer choices, synthetic data generation methods, and language model pretraining on reasoning performance. Our training dataset, findings, and baseline pave the way for developing small ALMs capable of reasoning.</p></details> | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Checkpoint and dataset available at:

In this paper, we introduce Audio Flamingo 2 (AF2), an Audio-Language Model (ALM) with advanced audio understanding and reasoning capabilities. AF2 leverages (i) a custom CLAP model, (ii) synthetic Audio QA data for fine-grained audio reasoning, and (iii) a multi-stage curriculum learning strategy. AF2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a 3B parameter small language model, surpassing large open-source and proprietary models across over 20 benchmarks. Next, for the first time, we extend audio understanding to long audio segments (30 secs to 5 mins) and propose LongAudio, a large and novel dataset for training ALMs on long audio captioning and question-answering tasks. Fine-tuning AF2 on LongAudio leads to exceptional performance on our proposed LongAudioBench, an expert annotated benchmark for evaluating ALMs on long audio understanding capabilities. We conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the efficacy of our approach. Project Website: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/AF2/.</p></details> | 2025-03-06 |  |
| **[Unbiased Sliced Wasserstein Kernels for High-Quality Audio Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05435v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teacher-forcing training for audio captioning usually leads to exposure bias due to training and inference mismatch. Prior works propose the contrastive method to deal with caption degeneration. However, the contrastive method ignores the temporal information when measuring similarity across acoustic and linguistic modalities, leading to inferior performance. In this work, we develop the temporal-similarity score by introducing the unbiased sliced Wasserstein RBF (USW-RBF) kernel equipped with rotary positional embedding to account for temporal information across modalities. In contrast to the conventional sliced Wasserstein RBF kernel, we can form an unbiased estimation of USW-RBF kernel via Monte Carlo estimation. Therefore, it is well-suited to stochastic gradient optimization algorithms, and its approximation error decreases at a parametric rate of $\mathcal{O}(L^{-1/2})$ with $L$ Monte Carlo samples. Additionally, we introduce an audio captioning framework based on the unbiased sliced Wasserstein kernel, incorporating stochastic decoding methods to mitigate caption degeneration during the generation process. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two datasets, AudioCaps and Clotho, to illustrate the capability of generating high-quality audio captions. Experimental results show that our framework is able to increase caption length, lexical diversity, and text-to-audio self-retrieval accuracy.</p></details> | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[ADIFF: Explaining audio difference using natural language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04476v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and explaining differences between audio recordings is crucial for fields like audio forensics, quality assessment, and audio generation. This involves identifying and describing audio events, acoustic scenes, signal characteristics, and their emotional impact on listeners. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively study the task of explaining audio differences and then propose benchmark, baselines for the task. First, we present two new datasets for audio difference explanation derived from the AudioCaps and Clotho audio captioning datasets. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we generate three levels of difference explanations: (1) concise descriptions of audio events and objects, (2) brief sentences about audio events, acoustic scenes, and signal properties, and (3) comprehensive explanations that include semantics and listener emotions. For the baseline, we use prefix tuning where audio embeddings from two audio files are used to prompt a frozen language model. Our empirical analysis and ablation studies reveal that the naive baseline struggles to distinguish perceptually similar sounds and generate detailed tier 3 explanations. To address these limitations, we propose ADIFF, which introduces a cross-projection module, position captioning, and a three-step training process to enhance the model's ability to produce detailed explanations. We evaluate our model using objective metrics and human evaluation and show our model enhancements lead to significant improvements in performance over naive baseline and SoTA Audio-Language Model (ALM) Qwen Audio. Lastly, we conduct multiple ablation studies to study the effects of cross-projection, language model parameters, position captioning, third stage fine-tuning, and present our findings. Our benchmarks, findings, and strong baseline pave the way for nuanced and human-like explanations of audio differences.</p></details> | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, we establish a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning. MILS seamlessly applies to media generation as well, discovering prompt rewrites to improve text-to-image generation, and even edit prompts for style transfer!

| **[CosyAudio: Improving Audio Generation with Confidence Scores and Synthetic Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16761v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation is an emerging area within AI-generated content (AIGC), where audio is created from natural language descriptions. Despite growing interest, developing robust TTA models remains challenging due to the scarcity of well-labeled datasets and the prevalence of noisy or inaccurate captions in large-scale, weakly labeled corpora. To address these challenges, we propose CosyAudio, a novel framework that utilizes confidence scores and synthetic captions to enhance the quality of audio generation. CosyAudio consists of two core components: AudioCapTeller and an audio generator. AudioCapTeller generates synthetic captions for audio and provides confidence scores to evaluate their accuracy. The audio generator uses these synthetic captions and confidence scores to enable quality-aware audio generation. Additionally, we introduce a self-evolving training strategy that iteratively optimizes CosyAudio across both well-labeled and weakly-labeled datasets. Initially trained with well-labeled data, AudioCapTeller leverages its assessment capabilities on weakly-labeled datasets for high-quality filtering and reinforcement learning, which further improves its performance. The well-trained AudioCapTeller refines corpora by generating new captions and confidence scores, serving for the audio generator training. Extensive experiments on open-source datasets demonstrate that CosyAudio outperforms existing models in automated audio captioning, generates more faithful audio, and exhibits strong generalization across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, their reasoning capabilities - critical for solving complex real-world problems - remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct the first exploration into integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into LALMs to enhance their reasoning ability across auditory modalities. We evaluate representative CoT methods, analyzing their performance in both information extraction and reasoning tasks across sound, music, and speech domains. Our findings reveal that CoT methods significantly improve performance on easy and medium tasks but encounter challenges with hard tasks, where reasoning chains can confuse the model rather than improve accuracy. Additionally, we identify a positive correlation between reasoning path length and accuracy, demonstrating the potential of scaling inference for advanced instruction-following and reasoning. This study not only highlights the promise of CoT in enhancing LALM reasoning capabilities but also identifies key limitations and provides actionable directions for future research.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |
| **[DRCap: Decoding CLAP Latents with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Zero-shot Audio Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09472v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While automated audio captioning (AAC) has made notable progress, traditional fully supervised AAC models still face two critical challenges: the need for expensive audio-text pair data for training and performance degradation when transferring across domains. To overcome these limitations, we present DRCap, a data-efficient and flexible zero-shot audio captioning system that requires text-only data for training and can quickly adapt to new domains without additional fine-tuning. DRCap integrates a contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) model and a large-language model (LLM) as its backbone. During training, the model predicts the ground-truth caption with a fixed text encoder from CLAP, whereas, during inference, the text encoder is replaced with the audio encoder to generate captions for audio clips in a zero-shot manner. To mitigate the modality gap of the CLAP model, we use both the projection strategy from the encoder side and the retrieval-augmented generation strategy from the decoder side. Specifically, audio embeddings are first projected onto a text embedding support to absorb extensive semantic information within the joint multi-modal space of CLAP. At the same time, similar captions retrieved from a datastore are fed as prompts to instruct the LLM, incorporating external knowledge to take full advantage of its strong generative capability. Conditioned on both the projected CLAP embedding and the retrieved similar captions, the model is able to produce a more accurate and semantically rich textual description. By tailoring the text embedding support and the caption datastore to the target domain, DRCap acquires a robust ability to adapt to new domains in a training-free manner. Experimental results demonstrate that DRCap outperforms all other zero-shot models in in-domain scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> | 2025-01-06 |  |
| **[Classifier-Guided Captioning Across Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03183v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most current captioning systems use language models trained on data from specific settings, such as image-based captioning via Amazon Mechanical Turk, limiting their ability to generalize to other modality distributions and contexts. This limitation hinders performance in tasks like audio or video captioning, where different semantic cues are needed. Addressing this challenge is crucial for creating more adaptable and versatile captioning frameworks applicable across diverse real-world contexts. In this work, we introduce a method to adapt captioning networks to the semantics of alternative settings, such as capturing audibility in audio captioning, where it is crucial to describe sounds and their sources. Our framework consists of two main components: (i) a frozen captioning system incorporating a language model (LM), and (ii) a text classifier that guides the captioning system. The classifier is trained on a dataset automatically generated by GPT-4, using tailored prompts specifically designed to enhance key aspects of the generated captions. Importantly, the framework operates solely during inference, eliminating the need for further training of the underlying captioning model. We evaluate the framework on various models and modalities, with a focus on audio captioning, and report promising results. Notably, when combined with an existing zero-shot audio captioning system, our framework improves its quality and sets state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot audio captioning.</p></details> | 2025-01-03 |  |

However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts, leading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem stems from the simplicity and scarcity of the training data. This work aims to create a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio generation models. We first develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed captions by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging labels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). The resulting dataset, Sound-VECaps, comprises 1.66M high-quality audio-caption pairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and environment information. We then demonstrate that training the text-to-audio generation models with Sound-VECaps significantly improves the performance on complex prompts. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of the models on several downstream audio-language tasks, showing the potential of Sound-VECaps in advancing audio-text representation learning.

Recently, AQA has garnered attention due to the advent of Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). Current literature focuses on constructing LALMs by integrating audio encoders with text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) through a projection module. While LALMs excel in general audio understanding, they are limited in temporal reasoning, which may hinder their commercial applications and on-device deployment. This paper addresses these challenges and limitations in audio temporal reasoning. First, we introduce a data augmentation technique for generating reliable audio temporal questions and answers using an LLM. Second, we perform a further fine-tuning of an existing baseline using curriculum learning strategy to specialize in temporal reasoning without compromising performance on fine-tuned tasks. We demonstrate the performance of our model using state-of-the-art LALMs on public audio benchmark datasets. Third, we implement our AQA model on-device locally and investigate its CPU inference for edge applications.</p></details> | 2024-12-13 | 9 pages, 6 figures |

To address this, we propose some metrics to elicit the model's confidence in its own generation. To assess how well these metrics replace correctness measures that leverage reference captions, we test their calibration with correctness measures. We discuss why some of these confidence metrics align better with certain correctness measures. Further, we provide insight into why temperature scaling of confidence metrics is effective. Our main contribution is a suite of well-calibrated lightweight confidence metrics for reference-free evaluation of captions in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | 2024-12-03 |  |

LASS aims to separate a target sound from an audio mixture given a natural language query, which provides a natural and scalable interface for digital audio applications. Recent works on LASS, despite attaining promising separation performance on specific sources (e.g., musical instruments, limited classes of audio events), are unable to separate audio concepts in the open domain. In this work, we introduce AudioSep, a foundation model for open-domain audio source separation with natural language queries. We train AudioSep on large-scale multimodal datasets and extensively evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks including audio event separation, musical instrument separation, and speech enhancement. AudioSep demonstrates strong separation performance and impressive zero-shot generalization ability using audio captions or text labels as queries, substantially outperforming previous audio-queried and language-queried sound separation models. For reproducibility of this work, we will release the source code, evaluation benchmark and pre-trained model at: https://github.com/Audio-AGI/AudioSep.</p></details> | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, benchmark and pre-trained models:

Specifically, we instruct VLMs to perform audio classification tasks in a few-shot setting by prompting them to classify a spectrogram image given example spectrogram images of each class. By carefully designing the spectrogram image representation and selecting good few-shot examples, we show that GPT-4o can achieve 59.00% cross-validated accuracy on the ESC-10 environmental sound classification dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that VLMs currently outperform the only available commercial audio language model with audio understanding capabilities (Gemini-1.5) on the equivalent audio classification task (59.00% vs. 49.62%), and even perform slightly better than human experts on visual spectrogram classification (73.75% vs. 72.50% on first fold). We envision two potential use cases for these findings: (1) combining the spectrogram and language understanding capabilities of VLMs for audio caption augmentation, and (2) posing visual spectrogram classification as a challenge task for VLMs.</p></details> | 2024-11-18 |  |
| **[MACE: Leveraging Audio for Evaluating Audio Captioning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00321v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) task aims to describe an audio signal using natural language. To evaluate machine-generated captions, the metrics should take into account audio events, acoustic scenes, paralinguistics, signal characteristics, and other audio information. Traditional AAC evaluation relies on natural language generation metrics like ROUGE and BLEU, image captioning metrics such as SPICE and CIDEr, or Sentence-BERT embedding similarity. However, these metrics only compare generated captions to human references, overlooking the audio signal itself. In this work, we propose MACE (Multimodal Audio-Caption Evaluation), a novel metric that integrates both audio and reference captions for comprehensive audio caption evaluation. MACE incorporates audio information from audio as well as predicted and reference captions and weights it with a fluency penalty. Our experiments demonstrate MACE's superior performance in predicting human quality judgments compared to traditional metrics. Specifically, MACE achieves a 3.28% and 4.36% relative accuracy improvement over the FENSE metric on the AudioCaps-Eval and Clotho-Eval datasets respectively. Moreover, it significantly outperforms all the previous metrics on the audio captioning evaluation task. The metric is opensourced at https://github.com/satvik-dixit/mace</p></details> | 2024-11-05 |  |
| **[EmotionCaps: Enhancing Audio Captioning Through Emotion-Augmented Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12028v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in audio-language modeling, such as automated audio captioning, has benefited from training on synthetic data generated with the aid of large-language models. However, such approaches for environmental sound captioning have primarily focused on audio event tags and have not explored leveraging emotional information that may be present in recordings. In this work, we explore the benefit of generating emotion-augmented synthetic audio caption data by instructing ChatGPT with additional acoustic information in the form of estimated soundscape emotion. To do so, we introduce EmotionCaps, an audio captioning dataset comprised of approximately 120,000 audio clips with paired synthetic descriptions enriched with soundscape emotion recognition (SER) information. We hypothesize that this additional information will result in higher-quality captions that match the emotional tone of the audio recording, which will, in turn, improve the performance of captioning models trained with this data. We test this hypothesis through both objective and subjective evaluation, comparing models trained with the EmotionCaps dataset to multiple baseline models. Our findings challenge current approaches to captioning and suggest new directions for developing and assessing captioning models.</p></details> | 2024-10-15 |  |

Recent progress in audio pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced audio understanding and textual reasoning capabilities, making improvements in AAC possible. In this paper, we propose SLAM-AAC to further enhance AAC with paraphrasing augmentation and CLAP-Refine through LLMs. Our approach uses the self-supervised EAT model to extract fine-grained audio representations, which are then aligned with textual embeddings via lightweight linear layers. The caption generation LLM is efficiently fine-tuned using the LoRA adapter. Drawing inspiration from the back-translation method in machine translation, we implement paraphrasing augmentation to expand the Clotho dataset during pre-training. This strategy helps alleviate the limitation of scarce audio-text pairs and generates more diverse captions from a small set of audio clips. During inference, we introduce the plug-and-play CLAP-Refine strategy to fully exploit multiple decoding outputs, akin to the n-best rescoring strategy in speech recognition. Using the CLAP model for audio-text similarity calculation, we could select the textual descriptions generated by multiple searching beams that best match the input audio. Experimental results show that SLAM-AAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on Clotho V2 and AudioCaps, surpassing previous mainstream models.</p></details> | 2024-10-12 |  |
| **[Enhancing Multimodal LLM for Detailed and Accurate Video Captioning using Multi-Round Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06682v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimization (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimized using DPO. To further improve training, we introduce a novel multi-round DPO (mrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initializing the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilize the process. To address potential catastrophic forgetting of non-captioning abilities due to mrDPO, we propose rebirth tuning, which finetunes the pre-DPO LLM by using the captions generated by the mrDPO-trained model as supervised labels. Experiments show that mrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing global and local error rates by 40\% and 20\%, respectively, while decreasing the repetition rate by 35\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmark among models of similar size. Upon acceptance, we will release the code, model checkpoints, and training and test data.

These models, fine-tuned on vast image datasets, exhibit a deep understanding of semantic concepts. In this work, we show that this ability can be re-purposed for audio captioning, where the joint image-language decoder can be leveraged to describe auditory content associated with image sequences within videos featuring audiovisual content. This can be achieved via multimodal alignment. Yet, this multimodal alignment task is non-trivial due to the inherent disparity between audible and visible elements in real-world videos. Moreover, multimodal representation learning often relies on contrastive learning, facing the challenge of the so-called modality gap which hinders smooth integration between modalities. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology for bridging the audiovisual modality gap by matching the distributions of tokens produced by an audio backbone and those of an image captioner. Our approach aligns the audio token distribution with that of the image tokens, enabling the model to perform zero-shot audio captioning in an unsupervised fashion while keeping the initial image captioning component unaltered. This alignment allows for the use of either audio or audiovisual input by combining or substituting the image encoder with the aligned audio encoder. Our method achieves significantly improved performances in zero-shot audio captioning, compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 2024-10-08 |  |

We propose OpenSep, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for automated audio separation, eliminating the need for manual intervention and overcoming source limitations. OpenSep uses textual inversion to generate captions from audio mixtures with off-the-shelf audio captioning models, effectively parsing the sound sources present. It then employs few-shot LLM prompting to extract detailed audio properties of each parsed source, facilitating separation in unseen mixtures. Additionally, we introduce a multi-level extension of the mix-and-separate training framework to enhance modality alignment by separating single source sounds and mixtures simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate OpenSep's superiority in precisely separating new, unseen, and variable sources in challenging mixtures, outperforming SOTA baseline methods.

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method to improve ZSAC with CLAP. Specifically, we shift from the conventional method of using prompts with abstract category labels (e.g., Sound of an organ) to prompts that describe sounds using their inherent descriptive features in a diverse context (e.g.,The organ's deep and resonant tones filled the cathedral.). To achieve this, we first propose ReCLAP, a CLAP model trained with rewritten audio captions for improved understanding of sounds in the wild. These rewritten captions describe each sound event in the original caption using their unique discriminative characteristics. ReCLAP outperforms all baselines on both multi-modal audio-text retrieval and ZSAC. Next, to improve zero-shot audio classification with ReCLAP, we propose prompt augmentation. In contrast to the traditional method of employing hand-written template prompts, we generate custom prompts for each unique label in the dataset. These custom prompts first describe the sound event in the label and then employ them in diverse scenes. Our proposed method improves ReCLAP's performance on ZSAC by 1%-18% and outperforms all baselines by 1% - 55%.</p></details> | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Checkpoints: https://github.com/Sreyan88/ReCLAP</p></details> |

However, for audio representation learning, existing datasets suffer from limitations in the following aspects: insufficient volume, simplistic content, and arduous collection procedures. To establish an audio dataset with high-quality captions, we propose an innovative, automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs, such as video frames, audio streams. Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality, audio-language dataset, named as Auto-ACD, comprising over 1.5M audio-text pairs. We exploit a series of pre-trained models or APIs, to determine audio-visual synchronisation, generate image captions, object detection, or audio tags for specific videos. Subsequently, we employ LLM to paraphrase a congruent caption for each audio, guided by the extracted multi-modality clues. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset, we train widely used models on our dataset and show performance improvement on various downstream tasks, for example, audio-language retrieval, audio captioning, zero-shot classification. In addition, we establish a novel benchmark with environmental information and provide a benchmark for audio-text tasks.</p></details> | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024</p></details> |

This leads to a shared embedding space in which corresponding items from the two modalities end up close together. Since audio-caption datasets typically only contain matching pairs of recordings and descriptions, it has become common practice to create mismatching pairs by pairing the audio with a caption randomly drawn from the dataset. This is not ideal because the randomly sampled caption could, just by chance, partly or entirely describe the audio recording. However, correspondence information for all possible pairs is costly to annotate and thus typically unavailable; we, therefore, suggest substituting it with estimated correspondences. To this end, we propose a two-staged training procedure in which multiple retrieval models are first trained as usual, i.e., without estimated correspondences. In the second stage, the audio-caption correspondences predicted by these models then serve as prediction targets. We evaluate our method on the ClothoV2 and the AudioCaps benchmark and show that it improves retrieval performance, even in a restricting self-distillation setting where a single model generates and then learns from the estimated correspondences. We further show that our method outperforms the current state of the art by 1.6 pp. mAP@10 on the ClothoV2 benchmark.</p></details> | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Detection and Classification of

Audio-language models (ALMs) trained using a contrastive approach (e.g., CLAP) that learns a shared representation between audio and language modalities have improved performance in many downstream applications, including zero-shot audio classification, audio retrieval, etc. However, the ability of these models to effectively perform compositional reasoning remains largely unexplored and necessitates additional research. In this paper, we propose CompA, a collection of two expert-annotated benchmarks with a majority of real-world audio samples, to evaluate compositional reasoning in ALMs. Our proposed CompA-order evaluates how well an ALM understands the order or occurrence of acoustic events in audio, and CompA-attribute evaluates attribute-binding of acoustic events. An instance from either benchmark consists of two audio-caption pairs, where both audios have the same acoustic events but with different compositions. An ALM is evaluated on how well it matches the right audio to the right caption. Using this benchmark, we first show that current ALMs perform only marginally better than random chance, thereby struggling with compositional reasoning. Next, we propose CompA-CLAP, where we fine-tune CLAP using a novel learning method to improve its compositional reasoning abilities. To train CompA-CLAP, we first propose improvements to contrastive training with composition-aware hard negatives, allowing for more focused training. Next, we propose a novel modular contrastive loss that helps the model learn fine-grained compositional understanding and overcomes the acute scarcity of openly available compositional audios. CompA-CLAP significantly improves over all our baseline models on the CompA benchmark, indicating its superior compositional reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024.

These Audio-Language Models (ALMs) are trained on a vast number of audio-text pairs and show remarkable performance in tasks including Text-to-Audio Retrieval, Captioning, and Question Answering. However, their ability to engage in more complex open-ended tasks, like Interactive Question-Answering, requires proficiency in logical reasoning -- a skill not yet benchmarked. We introduce the novel task of Audio Entailment to evaluate an ALM's deductive reasoning ability. This task assesses whether a text description (hypothesis) of audio content can be deduced from an audio recording (premise), with potential conclusions being entailment, neutral, or contradiction, depending on the sufficiency of the evidence. We create two datasets for this task with audio recordings sourced from two audio captioning datasets -- AudioCaps and Clotho -- and hypotheses generated using Large Language Models (LLMs). We benchmark state-of-the-art ALMs and find deficiencies in logical reasoning with both zero-shot and linear probe evaluations. Finally, we propose "caption-before-reason", an intermediate step of captioning that improves the zero-shot and linear-probe performance of ALMs by an absolute 6% and 3%, respectively.</p></details> | 2024-07-25 |  |

However, these models have become increasingly large as their performance is enhanced. In this work, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) framework for AAC. Our analysis shows that in the encoder-decoder based AAC models, it is more effective to distill knowledge into the encoder as compared with the decoder. To this end, we incorporate encoder-level KD loss into training, in addition to the standard supervised loss and sequence-level KD loss. We investigate two encoder-level KD methods, based on mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that contrastive KD is more robust than MSE KD, exhibiting superior performance in data-scarce situations. By leveraging audio-only data into training in the KD framework, our student model achieves competitive performance, with an inference speed that is 19 times faster\footnote{An online demo is available at \url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/wsntxxn/efficient_audio_captioning}}.</p></details> | 2024-07-19 | Interspeech 2024 |

However, researchers face challenges due to the costly and time-consuming collection process of existing audio-language datasets, which are limited in size. To address this data scarcity issue, we introduce WavCaps, the first large-scale weakly-labelled audio captioning dataset, comprising approximately 400k audio clips with paired captions. We sourced audio clips and their raw descriptions from web sources and a sound event detection dataset. However, the online-harvested raw descriptions are highly noisy and unsuitable for direct use in tasks such as automated audio captioning. To overcome this issue, we propose a three-stage processing pipeline for filtering noisy data and generating high-quality captions, where ChatGPT, a large language model, is leveraged to filter and transform raw descriptions automatically. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of WavCaps dataset and evaluate it on multiple downstream audio-language multimodal learning tasks. The systems trained on WavCaps outperform previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by a significant margin. Our aspiration is for the WavCaps dataset we have proposed to facilitate research in audio-language multimodal learning and demonstrate the potential of utilizing ChatGPT to enhance academic research.

Recent research advances in audio captioning have introduced additional guidance to improve the accuracy of audio events in generated sentences. However, temporal relations between audio events have received little attention while revealing complex relations is a key component in summarizing audio content. Therefore, this paper aims to better capture temporal relationships in caption generation with sound event detection (SED), a task that locates events' timestamps. We investigate the best approach to integrate temporal information in a captioning model and propose a temporal tag system to transform the timestamps into comprehensible relations. Results evaluated by the proposed temporal metrics suggest that great improvement is achieved in terms of temporal relation generation.</p></details> | 2024-07-18 | Interspeech 2023 |

Previous mainstream audio-and-text LLMs use discrete audio tokens to represent both input and output audio; however, they suffer from performance degradation on tasks such as automatic speech recognition, speech-to-text translation, and speech enhancement over models using continuous speech features. In this paper, we propose LauraGPT, a novel unified audio-and-text GPT-based LLM for audio recognition, understanding, and generation. LauraGPT is a versatile LLM that can process both audio and text inputs and generate outputs in either modalities. We propose a novel data representation that combines continuous and discrete features for audio: LauraGPT encodes input audio into continuous representations using an audio encoder and generates output audio from discrete codec codes. We propose a one-step codec vocoder to overcome the prediction challenge caused by the multimodal distribution of codec tokens. We fine-tune LauraGPT using supervised multi-task learning. Extensive experiments show that LauraGPT consistently achieves comparable to superior performance compared to strong baselines on a wide range of audio tasks related to content, semantics, paralinguistics, and audio-signal analysis, such as automatic speech recognition, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech synthesis, speech enhancement, automated audio captioning, speech emotion recognition, and spoken language understanding.</p></details> | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, work in progress</p></details> |

This task has attracted increasing attention and substantial progress has been made in recent years. Captions generated by existing models are generally faithful to the content of audio clips, however, these machine-generated captions are often deterministic (e.g., generating a fixed caption for a given audio clip), simple (e.g., using common words and simple grammar), and generic (e.g., generating the same caption for similar audio clips). When people are asked to describe the content of an audio clip, different people tend to focus on different sound events and describe an audio clip diversely from various aspects using distinct words and grammar. We believe that an audio captioning system should have the ability to generate diverse captions, either for a fixed audio clip, or across similar audio clips. To this end, we propose an adversarial training framework based on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) to improve diversity of audio captioning systems. A caption generator and two hybrid discriminators compete and are learned jointly, where the caption generator can be any standard encoder-decoder captioning model used to generate captions, and the hybrid discriminators assess the generated captions from different criteria, such as their naturalness and semantics. We conduct experiments on the Clotho dataset. The results show that our proposed model can generate captions with better diversity as compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 2024-06-28 | Accepted to TASLP |

Recently, the advancements in large language models (LLMs), with improvements in training approaches for audio encoders, have opened up possibilities for improving AAC. Thus, we explore enhancing AAC from three aspects: 1) a pre-trained audio encoder via consistent ensemble distillation (CED) is used to improve the effectivity of acoustic tokens, with a querying transformer (Q-Former) bridging the modality gap to LLM and compress acoustic tokens; 2) we investigate the advantages of using a Llama 2 with 7B parameters as the decoder; 3) another pre-trained LLM corrects text errors caused by insufficient training data and annotation ambiguities. Both the audio encoder and text decoder are optimized by low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Experiments show that each of these enhancements is effective.

Previous research has primarily focused on assessing the performance of LALMs across various tasks, yet overlooking their reliability, particularly concerning issues like object hallucination. In our study, we introduce methods to assess the extent of object hallucination of publicly available LALMs. Our findings reveal that LALMs are comparable to specialized audio captioning models in their understanding of audio content, but struggle to answer discriminative questions, specifically those requiring the identification of the presence of particular object sounds within an audio clip. This limitation highlights a critical weakness in current LALMs: their inadequate understanding of discriminative queries.

| **[Zero-Shot Audio Captioning Using Soft and Hard Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06295v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traditional audio captioning methods, a model is usually trained in a fully supervised manner using a human-annotated dataset containing audio-text pairs and then evaluated on the test sets from the same dataset. Such methods have two limitations. First, these methods are often data-hungry and require time-consuming and expensive human annotations to obtain audio-text pairs. Second, these models often suffer from performance degradation in cross-domain scenarios, i.e., when the input audio comes from a different domain than the training set, which, however, has received little attention. We propose an effective audio captioning method based on the contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) model to address these issues. Our proposed method requires only textual data for training, enabling the model to generate text from the textual feature in the cross-modal semantic space.In the inference stage, the model generates the descriptive text for the given audio from the audio feature by leveraging the audio-text alignment from CLAP.We devise two strategies to mitigate the discrepancy between text and audio embeddings: a mixed-augmentation-based soft prompt and a retrieval-based acoustic-aware hard prompt. These approaches are designed to enhance the generalization performance of our proposed model, facilitating the model to generate captions more robustly and accurately. Extensive experiments on AudioCaps and Clotho benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms other zero-shot audio captioning approaches for in-domain scenarios and outperforms the compared methods for cross-domain scenarios, underscoring the generalization ability of our method.</p></details> | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language

However, audio-language learning faces challenges due to limited and lower-quality data compared to image-language tasks. Existing audio-language datasets are notably smaller, and manual labeling is hindered by the need to listen to entire audio clips for accurate labeling. Our method systematically generates audio-caption pairs by augmenting audio clips with natural language labels and corresponding audio signal processing operations. Leveraging a Large Language Model, we generate descriptions of augmented audio clips with a prompt template. This scalable method produces AudioSetMix, a high-quality training dataset for text-and-audio related models. Integration of our dataset improves models performance on benchmarks by providing diversified and better-aligned examples. Notably, our dataset addresses the absence of modifiers (adjectives and adverbs) in existing datasets. By enabling models to learn these concepts, and generating hard negative examples during training, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | 2024-06-07 | typos corrected |

Examining reasoning with text and sound components in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04615v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, notably in connecting ideas and adhering to logical rules to solve problems. These models have evolved to accommodate various data modalities, including sound and images, known as multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which are capable of describing images or sound recordings. Previous work has demonstrated that when the LLM component in MLLMs is frozen, the audio or visual encoder serves to caption the sound or image input facilitating text-based reasoning with the LLM component. We are interested in using the LLM's reasoning capabilities in order to facilitate classification. In this paper, we demonstrate through a captioning/classification experiment that an audio MLLM cannot fully leverage its LLM's text-based reasoning when generating audio captions. We also consider how this may be due to MLLMs separately representing auditory and textual information such that it severs the reasoning pathway from the LLM to the audio encoder.</p></details> | 2024-06-07 | 9 pages |

Additionally, our proposed method can transfer to any domain without the need for any additional fine-tuning. To generate a caption for an audio sample, we leverage an audio-text model CLAP to retrieve captions similar to it from a replaceable datastore, which are then used to construct a prompt. Next, we feed this prompt to a GPT-2 decoder and introduce cross-attention layers between the CLAP encoder and GPT-2 to condition the audio for caption generation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, Clotho and AudioCaps, show that RECAP achieves competitive performance in in-domain settings and significant improvements in out-of-domain settings. Additionally, due to its capability to exploit a large text-captions-only datastore in a training-free fashion, RECAP shows unique capabilities of captioning novel audio events never seen during training and compositional audios with multiple events. To promote research in this space, we also release 150,000+ new weakly labeled captions for AudioSet, AudioCaps, and Clotho.</p></details> | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2024.

In addition to dialogues, Audio Dialogues also has question-answer pairs to understand and compare multiple input audios together. Audio Dialogues leverages a prompting-based approach and caption annotations from existing datasets to generate multi-turn dialogues using a Large Language Model (LLM). We evaluate existing audio-augmented large language models on our proposed dataset to demonstrate the complexity and applicability of Audio Dialogues.

In this paper, we propose SALMONN, a speech audio language music open neural network, built by integrating a pre-trained text-based large language model (LLM) with speech and audio encoders into a single multimodal model. SALMONN enables the LLM to directly process and understand general audio inputs and achieve competitive performances on a number of speech and audio tasks used in training, such as automatic speech recognition and translation, auditory-information-based question answering, emotion recognition, speaker verification, and music and audio captioning etc. SALMONN also has a diverse set of emergent abilities unseen in the training, which includes but is not limited to speech translation to untrained languages, speech-based slot filling, spoken-query-based question answering, audio-based storytelling, and speech audio co-reasoning etc. The presence of cross-modal emergent abilities is studied, and a novel few-shot activation tuning approach is proposed to activate such abilities. To our knowledge, SALMONN is the first model of its type and can be regarded as a step towards AI with generic hearing abilities.

The assessment of audio captioning systems is typically based on quantitative metrics applied to text data. Previous studies have employed metrics derived from machine translation and image captioning to evaluate the quality of generated audio captions. Drawing inspiration from auditory cognitive neuroscience research, we introduce a novel metric approach -- Audio Captioning Evaluation on Semantics of Sound (ACES). ACES takes into account how human listeners parse semantic information from sounds, providing a novel and comprehensive evaluation perspective for automated audio captioning systems. ACES combines semantic similarities and semantic entity labeling. ACES outperforms similar automated audio captioning metrics on the Clotho-Eval FENSE benchmark in two evaluation categories.</p></details> | 2024-03-27 |  |

In computer vision, LLMs can be used to prime vision-language tasks such image captioning and visual question answering when coupled with pre-trained vision backbones. While different approaches have been explored to interface LLMs with ``perceptual backbones'' that process, e.g., visual or audio data, they are often explored for different tasks, different datasets, and using different perceptual backbones and language models, hindering direct comparison of the interfacing mechanisms. To remedy this lack of comparability between methods, we present an extensive experimental evaluation of different interfacing mechanisms, across multiple tasks (including image, video, and audio captioning as well as visual question answering), datasets and backbones, paying special attention to low-data settings. We find improved performance using existing mechanisms over state-of-the-art results, and identify a new interfacing mechanism that yields (near) optimal results across different tasks, while obtaining a 4x reduction in training time.</p></details> | 2024-03-20 |  |

However, most of the existing audio-text datasets contain only simple descriptions of sound events. Compared with classification labels, the advantages of such descriptions are significantly limited. In this paper, we first analyze the detailed information that human descriptions of audio may contain beyond sound event labels. Based on the analysis, we propose an automatic pipeline for curating audio-text pairs with rich details. Leveraging the property that sounds can be mixed and concatenated in the time domain, we control details in four aspects: temporal relationship, loudness, speaker identity, and occurrence number, in simulating audio mixtures. Corresponding details are transformed into captions by large language models. Audio-text pairs with rich details in text descriptions are thereby obtained. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline with a small amount of simulated data, demonstrating that the simulated data enables models to learn detailed audio captioning.</p></details> | 2024-03-07 |  |

Most existing methods incorporate the visual modality as a pivot for audio-text pre-training, which inevitably induces data noise. In this paper, we propose to utilize audio captioning to generate text directly from audio, without the aid of the visual modality so that potential noise from modality mismatch is eliminated. Furthermore, we propose caption generation under the guidance of AudioSet tags, leading to more accurate captions. With the above two improvements, we curate high-quality, large-scale parallel audio-text data, based on which we perform audio-text pre-training. We comprehensively demonstrate the performance of the pre-trained model on a series of downstream audio-related tasks, including single-modality tasks like audio classification and tagging, as well as cross-modal tasks consisting of audio-text retrieval and audio-based text generation. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot classification performance on most datasets, suggesting the effectiveness of our synthetic data. The audio encoder also serves as an efficient pattern recognition model by fine-tuning it on audio-related tasks. Synthetic data and pre-trained models are available online.</p></details> | 2024-03-05 |  |

Facilitating models in comprehending text information plays a pivotal role in establishing a seamless connection between the two modalities of text and audio. While recent research has focused on closing the gap between these two modalities through contrastive learning, it is challenging to bridge the difference between both modalities using only simple contrastive loss. This paper introduces Enhance Depth of Text Comprehension (EDTC), which enhances the model's understanding of text information from three different perspectives. First, we propose a novel fusion module, FUSER, which aims to extract shared semantic information from different audio features through feature fusion. We then introduced TRANSLATOR, a novel alignment module designed to align audio features and text features along the tensor level. Finally, the weights are updated by adding momentum to the twin structure so that the model can learn information about both modalities at the same time. The resulting method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AudioCaps datasets and demonstrates results comparable to the state-of-the-art on Clotho datasets.</p></details> | 2024-02-27 |  |

These approaches have led to the development of versatile models capable of tackling a wide array of tasks, while delivering state-of-the-art performance. However, current models inherently lack the capacity to produce the requisite language for open-ended tasks, such as Audio Captioning or Audio Question & Answering. We introduce Pengi, a novel Audio Language Model that leverages Transfer Learning by framing all audio tasks as text-generation tasks. It takes as input, an audio recording, and text, and generates free-form text as output. The input audio is represented as a sequence of continuous embeddings by an audio encoder. A text encoder does the same for the corresponding text input. Both sequences are combined as a prefix to prompt a pre-trained frozen language model. The unified architecture of Pengi enables open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks without any additional fine-tuning or task-specific extensions. When evaluated on 22 downstream tasks, our approach yields state-of-the-art performance in several of them. Our results show that connecting language models with audio models is a major step towards general-purpose audio understanding</p></details> | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2023.

Recent methods unlock learning joint audio-text embeddings from raw audio-text pairs describing audio in natural language. Despite recent advancements, there is little exploration of systematic methods to train models for recognizing sound events and sources in alternative scenarios, such as distinguishing fireworks from gunshots at outdoor events in similar situations. This study introduces causal reasoning and counterfactual analysis in the audio domain. We use counterfactual instances and include them in our model across different aspects. Our model considers acoustic characteristics and sound source information from human-annotated reference texts. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we conducted pre-training utilizing multiple audio captioning datasets. We then evaluate with several common downstream tasks, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method as one of the first works leveraging counterfactual information in audio domain. Specifically, the top-1 accuracy in open-ended language-based audio retrieval task increased by more than 43%.</p></details> | 2024-01-10 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2024</p></details> |

In recent years, AAC has quickly attracted research interest, with state-of-the-art systems now relying on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) backbone powered by strong models such as Transformers. Following the macro-trend of applied machine learning research, in this work, we strive to improve the performance of seq2seq AAC models by extensively leveraging pretrained models and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we utilize BEATs to extract fine-grained audio features. Then, we employ Instructor LLM to fetch text embeddings of captions, and infuse their language-modality knowledge into BEATs audio features via an auxiliary InfoNCE loss function. Moreover, we propose a novel data augmentation method that uses ChatGPT to produce caption mix-ups (i.e., grammatical and compact combinations of two captions) which, together with the corresponding audio mixtures, increase not only the amount but also the complexity and diversity of training data. During inference, we propose to employ nucleus sampling and a hybrid reranking algorithm, which has not been explored in AAC research. Combining our efforts, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art 32.6 SPIDEr-FL score on the Clotho evaluation split, and wins the 2023 DCASE AAC challenge.</p></details> | 2024-01-10 | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2024 camera-ready paper.

The significance of possessing high-quality, diverse, and extensive AQA datasets cannot be overstated when aiming for the precision of an AQA system. While there has been notable focus on developing accurate and efficient AQA models, the creation of high-quality, diverse, and extensive datasets for the specific task at hand has not garnered considerable attention. To address this challenge, this work makes several contributions. We introduce a scalable AQA data generation pipeline, denoted as the AQUALLM framework, which relies on Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework utilizes existing audio-caption annotations and incorporates state-of-the-art LLMs to generate expansive, high-quality AQA datasets. Additionally, we present three extensive and high-quality benchmark datasets for AQA, contributing significantly to the progression of AQA research. AQA models trained on the proposed datasets set superior benchmarks compared to the existing state-of-the-art. Moreover, models trained on our datasets demonstrate enhanced generalizability when compared to models trained using human-annotated AQA data.

However, real-world audio creation aims to generate harmonious audio containing various elements such as speech, music, and sound effects with controllable conditions, which is challenging to address using existing audio generation systems. We present WavJourney, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to connect various audio models for audio creation. WavJourney allows users to create storytelling audio content with diverse audio elements simply from textual descriptions. Specifically, given a text instruction, WavJourney first prompts LLMs to generate an audio script that serves as a structured semantic representation of audio elements. The audio script is then converted into a computer program, where each line of the program calls a task-specific audio generation model or computational operation function. The computer program is then executed to obtain a compositional and interpretable solution for audio creation. Experimental results suggest that WavJourney is capable of synthesizing realistic audio aligned with textually-described semantic, spatial and temporal conditions, achieving state-of-the-art results on text-to-audio generation benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a new multi-genre story benchmark. Subjective evaluations demonstrate the potential of WavJourney in crafting engaging storytelling audio content from text. We further demonstrate that WavJourney can facilitate human-machine co-creation in multi-round dialogues.

AAC requires recognizing contents such as the environment, sound events and the temporal relationships between sound events and describing these elements with a fluent sentence. Currently, an encoder-decoder-based deep learning framework is the standard approach to tackle this problem. Plenty of works have proposed novel network architectures and training schemes, including extra guidance, reinforcement learning, audio-text self-supervised learning and diverse or controllable captioning. Effective data augmentation techniques, especially based on large language models are explored. Benchmark datasets and AAC-oriented evaluation metrics also accelerate the improvement of this field.

Different from speech recognition which translates audio content that contains spoken language into text, audio captioning is commonly concerned with ambient sounds, or sounds produced by a human performing an action. Inspired by zero-shot image captioning methods, we propose ZerAuCap, a novel framework for summarising such general audio signals in a text caption without requiring task-specific training. In particular, our framework exploits a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for generating the text which is guided by a pre-trained audio-language model to produce captions that describe the audio content. Additionally, we use audio context keywords that prompt the language model to generate text that is broadly relevant to sounds. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot audio captioning on the AudioCaps and Clotho datasets.

In this paper, we resort to establish connections between multi-modality video tracks, including Vision, Audio, and Subtitle, and Text by exploring an automatically generated large-scale omni-modality video caption dataset called VAST-27M. Specifically, we first collect 27 million open-domain video clips and separately train a vision and an audio captioner to generate vision and audio captions. Then, we employ an off-the-shelf Large Language Model (LLM) to integrate the generated captions, together with subtitles and instructional prompts into omni-modality captions. Based on the proposed VAST-27M dataset, we train an omni-modality video-text foundational model named VAST, which can perceive and process vision, audio, and subtitle modalities from video, and better support various tasks including vision-text, audio-text, and multi-modal video-text tasks (retrieval, captioning and QA). Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed VAST-27M corpus and VAST foundation model.

However, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming to collect a sufficient number of paired audio and captions. Motivated by the recent advances in Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), we propose a weakly-supervised approach to train an AAC model assuming only text data and a pre-trained CLAP model, alleviating the need for paired target data. Our approach leverages the similarity between audio and text embeddings in CLAP. During training, we learn to reconstruct the text from the CLAP text embedding, and during inference, we decode using the audio embeddings. To mitigate the modality gap between the audio and text embeddings we employ strategies to bridge the gap during training and inference stages. We evaluate our proposed method on Clotho and AudioCaps datasets demonstrating its ability to achieve a relative performance of up to ~$83\%$ compared to fully supervised approaches trained with paired target data.</p></details> | 2023-09-21 | DCASE Workshop 2023 |

However, the development of audio captioning methods can be biased due to the limited availability and quality of text-audio data. This paper proposes a SynthAC framework, which leverages recent advances in audio generative models and commonly available text corpus to create synthetic text-audio pairs, thereby enhancing text-audio representation. Specifically, the text-to-audio generation model, i.e., AudioLDM, is used to generate synthetic audio signals with captions from an image captioning dataset. Our SynthAC expands the availability of well-annotated captions from the text-vision domain to audio captioning, thus enhancing text-audio representation by learning relations within synthetic text-audio pairs. Experiments demonstrate that our SynthAC framework can benefit audio captioning models by incorporating well-annotated text corpus from the text-vision domain, offering a promising solution to the challenge caused by data scarcity. Furthermore, SynthAC can be easily adapted to various state-of-the-art methods, leading to substantial performance improvements.</p></details> | 2023-09-18 |  |

The fundamental concept of the proposed learning method is to create a feature representation space that preserves the relationship between audio, enabling the generation of captions that detail intricate audio information. This method employs a reference audio along with the input audio, both of which are transformed into feature representations via a shared encoder. Captions are then generated from these differential features to describe their differences. Furthermore, a unique technique is proposed that involves mixing the input audio with additional audio, and using the additional audio as a reference. This results in the difference between the mixed audio and the reference audio reverting back to the original input audio. This allows the original input's caption to be used as the caption for their difference, eliminating the need for additional annotations for the differences. In the experiments using the Clotho and ESC50 datasets, the proposed method demonstrated an improvement in the SPIDEr score by 7% compared to conventional methods.</p></details> | 2023-09-15 | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICASSP2024</p></details> |

| **[FlexiCodec: A Dynamic Neural Audio Codec for Low Frame Rates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00981v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural audio codecs are foundational to speech language models. It is expected to have a low frame rate and decoupled semantic and acoustic information. A lower frame rate codec can reduce the computational cost of speech language models by shortening the sequence length. Recent studies have developed 12.5Hz low-frame-rate audio codecs, but even lower frame rate codecs remain underexplored. We find that a major challenge for very low frame rate tokens is missing semantic information. This paper introduces FlexiCodec to address this limitation. FlexiCodec improves semantic preservation with a dynamic frame rate approach and introduces a novel architecture featuring an ASR feature-assisted dual stream encoding and Transformer bottlenecks. With dynamic frame rates, it uses less frames at information-sparse regions through adaptively merging semantically similar frames. A dynamic frame rate also allows FlexiCodec to support inference-time controllable frame rates between 3Hz and 12.5Hz. Experiments on 6.25Hz, 8.3Hz and 12.5Hz average frame rates confirm that FlexiCodec excels over baseline systems in semantic information preservation and delivers a high audio reconstruction quality. We also validate the effectiveness of FlexiCodec in language model-based TTS. Demos are available at: https://flexicodec.github.io</p></details> | 2025-10-02 |  |

One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets, covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.</p></details> | 2025-10-01 |  |
| **[Optimizing Speech Language Models for Acoustic Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26276v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model weights are available for exploration.</p></details> | 2025-09-30 |  |
| **[FuseCodec: Semantic-Contextual Fusion and Supervision for Neural Codecs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11425v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks.

| **[DM-Codec: Distilling Multimodal Representations for Speech Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15017v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in speech-language models have yielded significant improvements in speech tokenization and synthesis. However, effectively mapping the complex, multidimensional attributes of speech into discrete tokens remains challenging. This process demands acoustic, semantic, and contextual information for precise speech representations. Existing speech representations generally fall into two categories: acoustic tokens from audio codecs and semantic tokens from speech self-supervised learning models. Although recent efforts have unified acoustic and semantic tokens for improved performance, they overlook the crucial role of contextual representation in comprehensive speech modeling. Our empirical investigations reveal that the absence of contextual representations results in elevated Word Error Rate (WER) and Word Information Lost (WIL) scores in speech transcriptions. To address these limitations, we propose two novel distillation approaches: (1) a language model (LM)-guided distillation method that incorporates contextual information, and (2) a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided distillation technique that effectively distills multimodal representations (acoustic, semantic, and contextual) into a comprehensive speech tokenizer, termed DM-Codec. The DM-Codec architecture adopts a streamlined encoder-decoder framework with a Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) and incorporates the LM and SM during the training process. Experiments show DM-Codec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art speech tokenization models, reducing WER by up to 13.46%, WIL by 9.82%, and improving speech quality by 5.84% and intelligibility by 1.85% on the LibriSpeech benchmark dataset.

However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore, we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset, UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next generation of expressive S2ST systems.

We first emphasize the importance of collecting large-scale, spontaneous, high-quality unsupervised speech data, and show that continued pretraining HuBERT on this dataset outperforms both the base model and African-centric models on ASR. We then integrate this speech encoder into a Wolof LLM to train the first Speech LLM for this language, extending its capabilities to tasks such as speech translation. Furthermore, we explore training the Speech LLM to perform multi-step Chain-of-Thought before transcribing or translating. Our results show that the Speech LLM not only improves speech recognition but also performs well in speech translation. The models and the code will be openly shared.</p></details> | 2025-09-25 |  |
| **[HarmoniFuse: A Component-Selective and Prompt-Adaptive Framework for Multi-Task Speech Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18570v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models have facilitated the development of unified speech language models (SLMs) capable of supporting multiple speech tasks within a shared architecture. However, tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) rely on distinct types of information: ASR primarily depends on linguistic content, whereas SER requires the integration of both linguistic and paralinguistic cues. Existing multitask SLMs typically adopt naive parameter sharing or prompt-based conditioning without explicitly modeling the differences in information composition required by each task. Such designs risk task interference and performance degradation, especially under limited data conditions. To address these limitations, we propose HarmoniFuse, a component-selective and prompt-adaptive framework for multi-task speech language modeling. HarmoniFuse is designed to harmonize heterogeneous task demands by selecting and fusing task-relevant components of speech representations. Specifically, it integrates a gated speech encoder to extract task-specific acoustic features and a prompt-adaptive dynamic fusion module to aggregate transformer layers based on task characteristics. In addition, a batch-interleaved training strategy enables leveraging separate ASR and SER datasets without requiring joint annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that HarmoniFuse improves both ASR and SER performance, offering a scalable and robust solution for multitask speech understanding under realistic data constraints.</p></details> | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages; submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

While existing research has examined how well SLMs encode shallow acoustic and phonetic features, the extent to which SLMs encode nuanced syntactic and conceptual features remains unclear.

Through minimal pair designs and diagnostic feature analysis across 71 tasks spanning diverse linguistic levels, our layer-wise and time-resolved analysis uncovers that 1) all speech encode grammatical features more robustly than conceptual ones.</p></details> | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference (Oral)</p></details> |

Comprehensive evaluation shows that Llama-Mimi achieves state-of-the-art performance in acoustic consistency and possesses the ability to preserve speaker identity. Our analysis further demonstrates that increasing the number of quantizers improves acoustic fidelity but degrades linguistic performance, highlighting the inherent challenge of maintaining long-term coherence.

This uniform token allocation mismatches the intrinsic structure of speech, where information is distributed unevenly over time. To address this, we propose VARSTok, a VAriable-frame-Rate Speech Tokenizer that adapts token allocation based on local feature similarity. VARSTok introduces two key innovations: (1) a temporal-aware density peak clustering algorithm that adaptively segments speech into variable-length units, and (2) a novel implicit duration coding scheme that embeds both content and temporal span into a single token index, eliminating the need for auxiliary duration predictors. Extensive experiments show that VARSTok significantly outperforms strong fixed-rate baselines. Notably, it achieves superior reconstruction naturalness while using up to 23% fewer tokens than a 40 Hz fixed-frame-rate baseline. VARSTok further yields lower word error rates and improved naturalness in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that a fully dynamic, variable-frame-rate acoustic speech tokenizer can be seamlessly integrated into downstream speech language models. Speech samples are available at https://zhengrachel.github.io/VARSTok.</p></details> | 2025-09-04 |  |

Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary, uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns.

Recent advancements in end-to-end speech language models, which unify speech understanding and generation, provide promising solutions. However, several challenges persist, including an over-reliance on large-scale dialogue datasets, insufficient extraction of paralinguistic cues vital for conveying empathy, and the lack of empathy-specific datasets and evaluation frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce OSUM-EChat, an open-source, end-to-end spoken dialogue system designed to enhance empathetic interactions, particularly in resource-limited settings. OSUM-EChat introduces two key innovations: (1) a three-stage understanding-driven spoken dialogue training strategy that extends the capabilities of a large speech understanding model to spoken dialogue tasks, and (2) a linguistic-paralinguistic dual thinking mechanism that integrates paralinguistic understanding through a chain of thought with dialogue generation, enabling the system to produce more empathetic responses. This approach reduces reliance on large-scale dialogue datasets while maintaining high-quality empathetic interactions. Additionally, we introduce the EChat-200K dataset, a rich corpus of empathetic speech-to-speech dialogues, and the EChat-eval benchmark, a comprehensive framework for evaluating the empathetic capabilities of dialogue systems. Experimental results demonstrate that OSUM-EChat outperforms end-to-end spoken dialogue models regarding empathetic responsiveness, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | 2025-09-03 |  |
| **[Entropy-based Coarse and Compressed Semantic Speech Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00503v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information, while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations. A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 2025-08-30 |  |
| **[CodecBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Acoustic and Semantic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20660v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of multimodal large language models (LLMs), audio codec plays an increasingly vital role in encoding audio into discrete tokens, enabling integration of audio into text-based LLMs. Current audio codec captures two types of information: acoustic and semantic. As audio codec is applied to diverse scenarios in speech language model , it needs to model increasingly complex information and adapt to varied contexts, such as scenarios with multiple speakers, background noise, or richer paralinguistic information. However, existing codec's own evaluation has been limited by simplistic metrics and scenarios, and existing benchmarks for audio codec are not designed for complex application scenarios, which limits the assessment performance on complex datasets for acoustic and semantic capabilities. We introduce CodecBench, a comprehensive evaluation dataset to assess audio codec performance from both acoustic and semantic perspectives across four data domains. Through this benchmark, we aim to identify current limitations, highlight future research directions, and foster advances in the development of audio codec.

Existing methods focus primarily on reducing the word error rate while ignoring the importance of lip-sync and acoustic quality. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM) based flow matching architecture for dubbing, named FlowDubber, which achieves high-quality audio-visual sync and pronunciation by incorporating a large speech language model and dual contrastive aligning while achieving better acoustic quality via the proposed voice-enhanced flow matching than previous works. First, we introduce Qwen2.5 as the backbone of LLM to learn the in-context sequence from movie scripts and reference audio. Then, the proposed semantic-aware learning focuses on capturing LLM semantic knowledge at the phoneme level. Next, dual contrastive aligning (DCA) boosts mutual alignment with lip movement, reducing ambiguities where similar phonemes might be confused. Finally, the proposed Flow-based Voice Enhancing (FVE) improves acoustic quality in two aspects, which introduces an LLM-based acoustics flow matching guidance to strengthen clarity and uses affine style prior to enhance identity when recovering noise into mel-spectrograms via gradient vector field prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two primary benchmarks.</p></details> | 2025-08-25 |  |

In this work, we introduce the Text-aware Diffusion Transformer Speech Codec (TaDiCodec), a novel approach designed to overcome these challenges. TaDiCodec employs end-to-end optimization for quantization and reconstruction through a diffusion autoencoder, while integrating text guidance into the diffusion decoder to enhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression. TaDiCodec achieves an extremely low frame rate of 6.25 Hz and a corresponding bitrate of 0.0875 kbps with a single-layer codebook for 24 kHz speech, while maintaining superior performance on critical speech generation evaluation metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity (SIM), and speech quality (UTMOS). Notably, TaDiCodec employs a single-stage, end-to-end training paradigm, and obviating the need for auxiliary pre-trained models. We also validate the compatibility of TaDiCodec in language model based zero-shot text-to-speech with both autoregressive modeling and masked generative modeling, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling, as well as a significantly small reconstruction-generation gap. We will open source our code and model checkpoints. Audio samples are are available at https:/tadicodec.github.io/.

Unlike in the vision-language domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open, end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong, reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models, LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset, pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.</p></details> | 2025-08-21 |  |

However, these discrete tokens are typically learned in advance, separately from the training of language models or downstream tasks. As a result, choices related to discretization, such as the SSL model used or the number of clusters, must be made heuristically. In particular, speech language models are expected to understand and generate responses that reflect not only the semantic content but also prosodic features. Yet, there has been limited research on the ability of discrete tokens to capture prosodic information. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis focusing on prosodic encoding based on their sensitivity to the artificially modified prosody, aiming to provide practical guidelines for designing discrete tokens.</p></details> | 2025-08-15 | Accepted by ASRU2025 |
| **[DualSpeechLM: Towards Unified Speech Understanding and Generation via Dual Speech Token Modeling with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08961v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)'s speech understanding or generation abilities by introducing various effective speech tokens has attracted great attention in the speech community. However, building a unified speech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges: (1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens, extending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data for fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information at different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features, while understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to difficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization and speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an Understanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level semantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text LLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which reduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech LLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that concurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a unified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision loss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and enhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between understanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of mutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.</p></details> | 2025-08-13 |  |

Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information within contextual settings.</p></details> | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE ICME 2025</p></details> |

However, they face a critical challenge -- their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken dialogue data. While text-guided speech generation could mitigate these issues, it suffers from timing and length issues when integrating textual guidance into double-channel audio streams, disrupting the precise time alignment essential for natural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose TurnGuide, a novel planning-inspired approach that mimics human conversational planning by dynamically segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating turn-level text guidance before speech output, which effectively resolves both insertion timing and length challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling them to generate semantically meaningful and coherent speech while maintaining natural conversational flow.

Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41% on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic understanding.

One key desirable capability for speech language models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long contexts.</p></details> | 2025-08-07 |  |
| **[Recent Advances in Speech Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03751v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant attention, primarily for their capabilities in text-based interactions. However, natural human interaction often relies on speech, necessitating a shift towards voice-based models. A straightforward approach to achieve this involves a pipeline of ``Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) + LLM + Text-to-Speech (TTS)", where input speech is transcribed to text, processed by an LLM, and then converted back to speech. Despite being straightforward, this method suffers from inherent limitations, such as information loss during modality conversion, significant latency due to the complex pipeline, and error accumulation across the three stages. To address these issues, Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) -- end-to-end models that generate speech without converting from text -- have emerged as a promising alternative.

A Systematic Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12537v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of speech tokenizer designs in LLM-centric SLMs, augmented by speech heads and speaker modeling. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.</p></details> | 2025-08-05 |  |
| **[Hearing More with Less: Multi-Modal Retrieval-and-Selection Augmented Conversational LLM-Based ASR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01166v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) aims to convert human speech content into corresponding text. In conversational scenarios, effectively utilizing context can enhance its accuracy. Large Language Models' (LLMs) exceptional long-context understanding and reasoning abilities enable LLM-based ASR (LLM-ASR) to leverage historical context for recognizing conversational speech, which has a high degree of contextual relevance. However, existing conversational LLM-ASR methods use a fixed number of preceding utterances or the entire conversation history as context, resulting in significant ASR confusion and computational costs due to massive irrelevant and redundant information. This paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval-and-selection method named MARS that augments conversational LLM-ASR by enabling it to retrieve and select the most relevant acoustic and textual historical context for the current utterance. Specifically, multi-modal retrieval obtains a set of candidate historical contexts, each exhibiting high acoustic or textual similarity to the current utterance. Multi-modal selection calculates the acoustic and textual similarities for each retrieved candidate historical context and, by employing our proposed near-ideal ranking method to consider both similarities, selects the best historical context. Evaluations on the Interspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge dataset show that the LLM-ASR, when trained on only 1.5K hours of data and equipped with the MARS, outperforms the state-of-the-art top-ranking system trained on 179K hours of data.</p></details> | 2025-08-02 |  |
| **[Scaling Analysis of Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02398v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Speech Language Model (SLM) scaling analysis paints a bleak picture. It predicts that SLMs require much more compute and data compared to text, leading some to question the feasibility of training high-quality SLMs. However, modern SLMs are often initialised from pre-trained TextLMs using speech-text interleaving to allow knowledge transfer. This raises the question - "Do interleaved SLMs scale more efficiently than textless-SLMs?" In this paper we answer a resounding yes! We conduct scaling analysis of interleaved SLMs by training several dozen and analysing the scaling trends. We see that under this setup SLMs scale more efficiently with compute. Additionally, our results indicate that the scaling dynamics significantly differ from textless-SLMs, suggesting one should allocate notably more of the compute budget to increasing model size over training tokens. We also study the role of synthetic data and TextLM model families in unlocking this potential. Results suggest that our scaled up model achieves comparable semantic speech performance to leading models, while using less compute and data. We open source models, samples, and data - https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/sims/ .</p></details> | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLM 2025</p></details> |

We propose a novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.</p></details> | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

| **[Locate-and-Focus: Enhancing Terminology Translation in Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18263v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays, yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.</p></details> | 2025-07-24 | Accepted at ACL 2025 |

Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups.

| **[FastLongSpeech: Enhancing Large Speech-Language Models for Efficient Long-Speech Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14815v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is at https://github.com/ictnlp/FastLongSpeech.

However, prior studies have found that existing dialogue pipelines for SARs remain limited in real-time latency, back-channeling, and personalized speech dialogue. Toward addressing these limitations, we propose using integrated end-to-end speech-language models (SLMs) with SARs. This work 1) evaluated the usability of an SLM-enabled SAR dialogue system through a small user study, and 2) identified remaining limitations through study user feedback to inform future improvements. We conducted a small within-participant user study with university students (N = 11) whose results showed that participants perceived an SLM-enabled SAR system as capable of providing empathetic feedback, natural turn-taking, back-channeling, and adaptive responses. We also found that participants reported the robot's nonverbal behaviors as lacking variability and synchronization with conversation, and the SLM's verbal feedback as generic and repetitive. These findings highlighted the need for real-time robot movement synchronized with conversation, improved prompting or fine-tuning to generate outputs better aligned with mental health practices, and more expressive, adaptive vocal generation.</p></details> | 2025-07-18 |  |
| **[StreamUni: Achieving Streaming Speech Translation with a Unified Large Speech-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07803v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality. However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.</p></details> | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is at https://github.com/ictnlp/StreamUni; The model is at

| **[Unlocking Speech Instruction Data Potential with Query Rewriting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08603v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets, previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets. Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting, increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and context-related abilities.</p></details> | 2025-07-11 | ACL 2025 Findings |

| **[Long-Form Speech Generation with Spoken Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18603v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time. From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time. Speech samples, the LibriSpeech-Long dataset, and any future code or model releases can be found at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/.</p></details> | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 (oral)</p></details> |

An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However, existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec, the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate.

To address these issues, we propose \textit{S2ST-Omni}, an efficient and scalable framework for multilingual S2ST. Specifically, we decompose the S2ST task into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). For S2TT, we propose an effective speech language model that integrates the pretrained Whisper encoder for robust audio understanding and Qwen 3.0 for advanced text comprehension. A lightweight speech adapter is employed to bridge the modality gap between speech and text representations. To further facilitate the multimodal knowledge learning, a two-stage fine-tuning strategy is introduced. In the TTS stage, we adopt a streaming autoregressive generation approach to produce natural and fluent target speech. Experiments on the CVSS benchmark show that S2ST-Omni consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art S2ST systems in translation quality, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | 2025-07-08 | Working in progress |

However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

| **[LM-SPT: LM-Aligned Semantic Distillation for Speech Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16738v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization, and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz. Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform baselines on text-to-speech tasks.</p></details> | 2025-06-20 |  |

We know that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show robust performance gains.</p></details> | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but also yields slightly better performance.

| **[NTPP: Generative Speech Language Modeling for Dual-Channel Spoken Dialogue via Next-Token-Pair Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00975v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.</p></details> | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniCharacter: Towards Immersive Role-Playing Agents with Seamless Speech-Language Personality Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20277v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/OmniCharacter.</p></details> | 2025-06-05 | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks. Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for spoken language generation.

| **[Language-Codec: Bridging Discrete Codec Representations and Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12208v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models have achieved significant success in generative tasks related to speech, audio, music, and other signal domains. A crucial element of these models is the discrete acoustic codecs, which serve as an intermediate representation replacing the mel-spectrogram. However, there exist several gaps between discrete codecs and downstream speech language models. Specifically, 1) Due to the reconstruction paradigm of the Codec model and the structure of residual vector quantization, the initial channel of the codebooks contains excessive information, making it challenging to directly generate acoustic tokens from weakly supervised signals such as text in downstream tasks. 2) numerous codebooks increases the burden on downstream speech language models. Consequently, leveraging the characteristics of speech language models, we propose Language-Codec. In the Language-Codec, we introduce a Masked Channel Residual Vector Quantization (MCRVQ) mechanism along with improved fourier transform structures and attention blocks, refined discriminator design to address the aforementioned gaps. We compare our method with competing audio compression algorithms and observe significant outperformance across extensive evaluations. Furthermore, we also validate the efficiency of the Language-Codec on downstream speech language models. The source code and pre-trained models can be accessed at https://github.com/jishengpeng/languagecodec .</p></details> | 2025-06-04 | ACL 2025 Main |

While speech tokenization has many options, their effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.</p></details> | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech2025</p></details> |

The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency.

The richer speech signal introduces new security risks compared to text-based models, as adversaries can better bypass safety mechanisms by injecting imperceptible noise to speech. We analyze adversarial attacks and find that SLMs are substantially more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate in some instances. To improve security, we propose post-hoc patching defenses used to intervene during inference by modifying the SLM's activations that improve robustness up to 99% with (i) negligible impact on utility and (ii) without any re-training. We conduct ablation studies to maximize the efficacy of our defenses and improve the utility/security trade-off, validated with large-scale benchmarks unique to SLMs.</p></details> | 2025-05-18 |  |

However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.</p></details> | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Train...</summary><p>Training and Inference Codes: https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/VITA-Audio</p></details> |

This paper introduces Ichigo, a mixed-modal model that seamlessly processes interleaved sequences of speech and text. Utilizing a tokenized early-fusion approach, Ichigo quantizes speech into discrete tokens and employs a uniform transformer-based architecture for both speech and text modalities. This method enables joint reasoning and generation across modalities without the need for separate adapters. We present a comprehensive training methodology, including pre-training on multilingual speech recognition datasets and fine-tuning on a curated instruction dataset. Ichigo demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on speech question-answering benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source speech language models and achieving comparable results to cascaded systems. Notably, Ichigo exhibits a latency of just 111 ms to first token generation, significantly lower than current models. Our approach not only advances the field of multimodal AI but also provides a framework for smaller research teams to contribute effectively to open-source speech-language models.</p></details> | 2025-04-04 |  |
| **[Continuous Speech Tokenizer in Text To Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17081v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fusion of speech and language in the era of large language models has garnered significant attention. Discrete speech token is often utilized in text-to-speech tasks for speech compression and portability, which is convenient for joint training with text and have good compression efficiency. However, we found that the discrete speech tokenizer still suffers from information loss. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective continuous speech tokenizer named Cont-SPT, and a text-to-speech model based on continuous speech tokens. Our results show that the speech language model based on the continuous speech tokenizer has better continuity and higher estimated Mean Opinion Scores (MoS). This enhancement is attributed to better information preservation rate of the continuous speech tokenizer across both low and high frequencies in the frequency domain.

However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging for the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or totally without vision-understanding capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech abilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we surprisingly notice that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is introduced for the flexible speech style controls including emotions and pitches. For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.</p></details> | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

| **[Universal Speech Token Learning via Low-Bitrate Neural Codec and Pretrained Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12115v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large speech language models are mainly based on semantic tokens from discretization of self-supervised learned representations and acoustic tokens from a neural codec, following a semantic-modeling and acoustic-synthesis paradigm. However, semantic tokens discard paralinguistic attributes of speakers that is important for natural spoken communication, while prompt-based acoustic synthesis from semantic tokens has limits in recovering paralinguistic details and suffers from robustness issues, especially when there are domain gaps between the prompt and the target. This paper unifies two types of tokens and proposes the UniCodec, a universal speech token learning that encapsulates all semantics of speech, including linguistic and paralinguistic information, into a compact and semantically-disentangled unified token. Such a unified token can not only benefit speech language models in understanding with paralinguistic hints but also help speech generation with high-quality output. A low-bitrate neural codec is leveraged to learn such disentangled discrete representations at global and local scales, with knowledge distilled from self-supervised learned features. Extensive evaluations on multilingual datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in generating natural, expressive and long-term consistent output quality with paralinguistic attributes well preserved in several speech processing tasks.</p></details> | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal

We hypothesize that this method limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality, preventing text-learned functions from being fully leveraged at appropriate abstraction levels. To address this, we propose augmenting vocabulary expansion with modules that better align abstraction levels across layers. Our models, \textsc{SmolTolk}, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with orders of magnitude more compute. Representation analyses and improved multimodal performance suggest our method enhances cross-modal transfer.</p></details> | 2025-03-08 |  |

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities.

However, current models rely heavily on low-level speech features, indicating they lack brain-relevant semantics which limits their utility as model organisms of semantic processing in the brain. In this work, we address this limitation by inducing brain-relevant bias directly into the models via fine-tuning with fMRI recordings of people listening to natural stories, a process we name brain-tuning. After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models' semantic understanding.</p></details> | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Earlier SpeechLMs focused on single-turn speech-based question answering (QA), where user input comprised a speech context and a text question. More recent studies have extended this to multi-turn conversations, though they often require complex, multi-stage supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with diverse data. Another critical challenge with SpeechLMs is catastrophic forgetting, where models optimized for speech tasks suffer significant degradation in text-only performance. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel single-stage joint speech-text SFT approach on the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of the LLM backbone. Our joint SFT combines text-only SFT data with three types of speech-related data: speech recognition and translation, speech-based QA, and mixed-modal SFT. Compared to previous SpeechLMs with 7B or 13B parameters, our 3B model demonstrates superior performance across various speech benchmarks while preserving the original capabilities on text-only tasks. Furthermore, our model shows emergent abilities of effectively handling previously unseen prompts and tasks, including multi-turn, mixed-modal inputs.</p></details> | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

Furthermore, our model exhibits the ability to follow complex instructions derived from LLMs, such as specific output formatting and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Moreover, HumanOmni integrates audio features to ensure a comprehensive understanding of environments and individuals. Our experiments validate HumanOmni's advanced capabilities in handling human-centric scenes across a variety of tasks, including emotion recognition, facial expression description, and action understanding.

Unlike traditional speech and audio segmentation, which mainly focuses on spectral changes in the input signal, e.g., phone segmentation, our approach tries to segment the spoken utterance into chunks with differing acoustic-semantic styles, focusing on acoustic-semantic information that does not translate well into text, e.g., emotion or speaker. While most Speech Segmentation tasks only handle one style change, e.g., emotion diarization, our approach tries to handle multiple acoustic-semantic style changes. Leveraging recent advances in Speech Language Models (SLMs), we propose a simple unsupervised method to segment a given speech utterance. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by considering several setups. Results suggest that the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines on boundary detection, segment purity, and over-segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/avishaiElmakies/unsupervised_speech_segmentation_using_slm.</p></details> | 2025-01-07 |  |
| **[Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation without Automatic Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16500v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One common approach for question answering over speech data is to first transcribe speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then employ text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the transcriptions. While this cascaded pipeline has proven effective in many practical settings, ASR errors can propagate to the retrieval and generation steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for open-question answering over spoken data. Our proposed approach fine-tunes a pre-trained speech encoder into a speech adapter fed into a frozen large language model (LLM)--based retrieval model. By aligning the embedding spaces of text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from text-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text retriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show that direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and outperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech language model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than transcripts. Without fine-tuning of the SLM, this approach outperforms cascaded text-based models when there is high WER in the transcripts.</p></details> | 2025-01-03 | ICASSP 2025 |
| **[SLIDE: Integrating Speech Language Model with LLM for Spontaneous Spoken Dialogue Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00805v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, ``textless" speech language models (SLMs) based on speech units have made huge progress in generating naturalistic speech, including non-verbal vocalizations. However, the generated speech samples often lack semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose SLM and LLM Integration for spontaneous spoken Dialogue gEneration (SLIDE). Specifically, we first utilize an LLM to generate the textual content of spoken dialogue. Next, we convert the textual dialogues into phoneme sequences and use a two-tower transformer-based duration predictor to predict the duration of each phoneme. Finally, an SLM conditioned on the spoken phoneme sequences is used to vocalize the textual dialogue. Experimental results on the Fisher dataset demonstrate that our system can generate naturalistic spoken dialogue while maintaining high semantic coherence.</p></details> | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Why Do Speech Language Models Fail to Generate Semantically Coherent Outputs? A Modality Evolving Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17048v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although text-based large language models exhibit human-level writing ability and remarkable intelligence, speech language models (SLMs) still struggle to generate semantically coherent outputs. There are several potential reasons for this performance degradation: (A) speech tokens mainly provide phonetic information rather than semantic information, (B) the length of speech sequences is much longer than that of text sequences, and (C) paralinguistic information, such as prosody, introduces additional complexity and variability. In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling. Based on these findings, we provide insights into the unique challenges of training SLMs and highlight pathways to develop more effective end-to-end SLMs.</p></details> | 2024-12-22 |  |
| **[SECodec: Structural Entropy-based Compressive Speech Representation Codec for Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00018v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech representations have become crucial for integrating speech into LLMs. Existing methods for speech representation discretization rely on a predefined codebook size and Euclidean distance-based quantization. However, 1) the size of codebook is a critical parameter that affects both codec performance and downstream task training efficiency. 2) The Euclidean distance-based quantization may lead to audio distortion when the size of the codebook is controlled within a reasonable range. In fact, in the field of information compression, structural information and entropy guidance are crucial, but previous methods have largely overlooked these factors. Therefore, we address the above issues from an information-theoretic perspective, we present SECodec, a novel speech representation codec based on structural entropy (SE) for building speech language models. Specifically, we first model speech as a graph, clustering the speech features nodes within the graph and extracting the corresponding codebook by hierarchically and disentangledly minimizing 2D SE. Then, to address the issue of audio distortion, we propose a new quantization method. This method still adheres to the 2D SE minimization principle, adaptively selecting the most suitable token corresponding to the cluster for each incoming original speech node. Furthermore, we develop a Structural Entropy-based Speech Language Model (SESLM) that leverages SECodec. Experimental results demonstrate that SECodec performs comparably to EnCodec in speech reconstruction, and SESLM surpasses VALL-E in zero-shot text-to-speech tasks. Code, demo speeches, speech feature graph, SE codebook, and models are available at https://github.com/wlq2019/SECodec.</p></details> | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial

| **[GLM-4-Voice: Towards Intelligent and Human-Like End-to-End Spoken Chatbot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02612v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GLM-4-Voice, an intelligent and human-like end-to-end spoken chatbot. It supports both Chinese and English, engages in real-time voice conversations, and varies vocal nuances such as emotion, intonation, speech rate, and dialect according to user instructions. GLM-4-Voice uses an ultra-low bitrate (175bps), single-codebook speech tokenizer with 12.5Hz frame rate derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by incorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. To efficiently transfer knowledge from text to speech modalities, we synthesize speech-text interleaved data from existing text pre-training corpora using a text-to-token model. We continue pre-training from the pre-trained text language model GLM-4-9B with a combination of unsupervised speech data, interleaved speech-text data, and supervised speech-text data, scaling up to 1 trillion tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both speech language modeling and spoken question answering. We then fine-tune the pre-trained model with high-quality conversational speech data, achieving superior performance compared to existing baselines in both conversational ability and speech quality. The open models can be accessed through https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4-Voice and https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-4-voice-9b.</p></details> | 2024-12-03 |  |
| **[Advancing Speech Language Models by Scaling Supervised Fine-Tuning with Over 60,000 Hours of Synthetic Speech Dialogue Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01078v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The GPT-4o represents a significant milestone in enabling real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, its remarkable low latency and high fluency not only capture attention but also stimulate research interest in the field. This real-time speech interaction is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring rapid feedback and immediate responses, dramatically enhancing user experience. However, there is a notable lack of research focused on real-time large speech language models, particularly for Chinese. In this work, we present KE-Omni, a seamless large speech language model built upon Ke-SpeechChat, a large-scale high-quality synthetic speech interaction dataset consisting of 7 million Chinese and English conversations, featuring 42,002 speakers, and totaling over 60,000 hours, This contributes significantly to the advancement of research and development in this field.

| **[Scaling Speech-Text Pre-training with Synthetic Interleaved Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17607v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech language models (SpeechLMs) accept speech input and produce speech output, allowing for more natural human-computer interaction compared to text-based large language models (LLMs). Traditional approaches for developing SpeechLMs are constrained by the limited availability of unsupervised speech data and parallel speech-text data, which are significantly less abundant than text pre-training data, thereby limiting their scalability as LLMs. We propose a novel approach to scaling speech-text pre-training by leveraging large-scale synthetic interleaved data derived from text corpora, eliminating the need for parallel speech-text datasets. Our method efficiently constructs speech-text interleaved data by sampling text spans from existing text corpora and synthesizing corresponding speech spans using a text-to-token model, bypassing the need to generate actual speech. We also employ a supervised speech tokenizer derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by incorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. This supervised training approach results in discrete speech tokens with strong semantic preservation even at lower frame rates (e.g. 12.5Hz), while still maintaining speech reconstruction quality. Starting from a pre-trained language model and scaling our pre-training to 1 trillion tokens (with 600B synthetic interleaved speech-text data), we achieve state-of-the-art performance in speech language modeling and spoken question answering, improving performance on spoken questions tasks from the previous SOTA of 13% (Moshi) to 31%. We further demonstrate that by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with speech dialogue data, we can develop an end-to-end spoken chatbot that achieves competitive performance comparable to existing baselines in both conversational abilities and speech quality, even operating exclusively in the speech domain.</p></details> | 2024-12-02 |  |
| **[Generative Pre-trained Speech Language Model with Efficient Hierarchical Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00976v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in speech language models have achieved significant progress, they face remarkable challenges in modeling the long acoustic sequences of neural audio codecs. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{S}peech \textbf{T}ransformer (GPST), a hierarchical transformer designed for efficient speech language modeling. GPST quantizes audio waveforms into two distinct types of discrete speech representations and integrates them within a hierarchical transformer architecture, allowing for a unified one-stage generation process and enhancing Hi-Res audio generation capabilities. By training on large corpora of speeches in an end-to-end unsupervised manner, GPST can generate syntactically consistent speech with diverse speaker identities. Given a brief 3-second prompt, GPST can produce natural and coherent personalized speech, demonstrating in-context learning abilities. Moreover, our approach can be easily extended to spoken cross-lingual speech generation by incorporating multi-lingual semantic tokens and universal acoustic tokens. Experimental results indicate that GPST significantly outperforms the existing speech language models in terms of word error rate, speech quality, and speaker similarity.

| **[SyllableLM: Learning Coarse Semantic Units for Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04029v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models require tokenized inputs. However, tokenization strategies for continuous data like audio and vision are often based on simple heuristics such as fixed sized convolutions or discrete clustering, which do not necessarily align with the semantic structure of the data. For speech in particular, the high resolution of waveforms (16,000 samples/second or more) presents a significant challenge as speech-based language models have had to use several times more tokens per word than text-based language models. In this work, we introduce a controllable self-supervised technique to merge speech representations into coarser syllable-like units while still preserving semantic information. We do this by 1) extracting noisy boundaries through analyzing correlations in pretrained encoder losses and 2) iteratively improving model representations with a novel distillation technique. Our method produces controllable-rate semantic units at as low as 5Hz and 60bps and achieves SotA in syllabic segmentation and clustering. Using these coarse tokens, we successfully train SyllableLM, a Speech Language Model (SpeechLM) that matches or outperforms current SotA SpeechLMs on a range of spoken language modeling tasks. SyllableLM also achieves significant improvements in efficiency with a 30x reduction in training compute and a 4x wall-clock inference speedup.</p></details> | 2024-10-05 | 10 pages, 2 figures |

Unlike other modalities such as vision or text, speech has unique temporal dependencies, making previous efficient inference works on other modalities not directly applicable. Furthermore, methods for efficient SpeechLM inference on long sequence and sparse signals remain largely unexplored. Then we propose FastAdaSP, a weighted token merging framework specifically designed for various speech-related tasks to improve the trade-off between efficiency and performance. Experimental results on WavLLM and Qwen-Audio show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) efficiency-performance trade-off compared with other baseline methods. Specifically, FastAdaSP achieved 7x memory efficiency and 1.83x decoding throughput without any degradation on tasks like Emotion Recognition (ER) and Spoken Question Answering (SQA).

| **[Just ASR + LLM? A Study on Speech Large Language Models' Ability to Identify and Understand Speaker in Spoken Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04927v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, we have observed a rapid advancement in speech language models (SpeechLLMs), catching up with humans' listening and reasoning abilities. SpeechLLMs have demonstrated impressive spoken dialog question-answering (SQA) performance in benchmarks like Gaokao, the English listening test of the college entrance exam in China, which seemingly requires understanding both the spoken content and voice characteristics of speakers in a conversation. However, after carefully examining Gaokao's questions, we find the correct answers to many questions can be inferred from the conversation transcript alone, i.e.\ without speaker segmentation and identification. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models Qwen-Audio and WavLLM on both Gaokao and our proposed "What Do You Like?" dataset shows a significantly higher accuracy in these context-based questions than in identity-critical questions, which can only be answered reliably with correct speaker identification. The results and analysis suggest that when solving SQA, the current SpeechLLMs exhibit limited speaker awareness from the audio and behave similarly to an LLM reasoning from the conversation transcription without sound. We propose that tasks focused on identity-critical questions could offer a more accurate evaluation framework of SpeechLLMs in SQA.</p></details> | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE SLT 2024</p></details> |
| **[Codec-SUPERB @ SLT 2024: A lightweight benchmark for neural audio codec models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14085v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural audio codec models are becoming increasingly important as they serve as tokenizers for audio, enabling efficient transmission or facilitating speech language modeling. The ideal neural audio codec should maintain content, paralinguistics, speaker characteristics, and audio information even at low bitrates. Recently, numerous advanced neural codec models have been proposed. However, codec models are often tested under varying experimental conditions. As a result, we introduce the Codec-SUPERB challenge at SLT 2024, designed to facilitate fair and lightweight comparisons among existing codec models and inspire advancements in the field. This challenge brings together representative speech applications and objective metrics, and carefully selects license-free datasets, sampling them into small sets to reduce evaluation computation costs.

However, audio codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we present the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can make the inference of LLM-based text-to-speech models around three times faster while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous models.</p></details> | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[LAST: Language Model Aware Speech Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03701v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech tokenization serves as the foundation of speech language model (LM), enabling them to perform various tasks such as spoken language modeling, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, etc. Most speech tokenizers are trained independently of the LM training process, relying on separate acoustic models and quantization methods. Following such an approach may create a mismatch between the tokenization process and its usage afterward. In this study, we propose a novel approach to training a speech tokenizer by leveraging objectives from pre-trained textual LMs. We advocate for the integration of this objective into the process of learning discrete speech representations. Our aim is to transform features from a pre-trained speech model into a new feature space that enables better clustering for speech LMs. We empirically investigate the impact of various model design choices, including speech vocabulary size and text LM size. Our results demonstrate the proposed tokenization method outperforms the evaluated baselines considering both spoken language modeling and speech-to-text. More importantly, unlike prior work, the proposed method allows the utilization of a single pre-trained LM for processing both speech and text inputs, setting it apart from conventional tokenization approaches.</p></details> | 2024-09-10 |  |
| **[Investigating Neural Audio Codecs for Speech Language Model-Based Speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04016v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural audio codec tokens serve as the fundamental building blocks for speech language model (SLM)-based speech generation. However, there is no systematic understanding on how the codec system affects the speech generation performance of the SLM. In this work, we examine codec tokens within SLM framework for speech generation to provide insights for effective codec design. We retrain existing high-performing neural codec models on the same data set and loss functions to compare their performance in a uniform setting. We integrate codec tokens into two SLM systems: masked-based parallel speech generation system and an auto-regressive (AR) plus non-auto-regressive (NAR) model-based system. Our findings indicate that better speech reconstruction in codec systems does not guarantee improved speech generation in SLM. A high-quality codec decoder is crucial for natural speech production in SLM, while speech intelligibility depends more on quantization mechanism.</p></details> | 2024-09-06 | Accepted by SLT-2024 |
| **[SpeechPrompt: Prompting Speech Language Models for Speech Processing Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13040v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a practical method for utilizing pre-trained language models (LMs). This approach offers several advantages. It allows an LM to adapt to new tasks with minimal training and parameter updates, thus achieving efficiency in both storage and computation. Additionally, prompting modifies only the LM's inputs and harnesses the generative capabilities of language models to address various downstream tasks in a unified manner. This significantly reduces the need for human labor in designing task-specific models. These advantages become even more evident as the number of tasks served by the LM scales up. Motivated by the strengths of prompting, we are the first to explore the potential of prompting speech LMs in the domain of speech processing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in converting speech into discrete units for language modeling. Our pioneer research demonstrates that these quantized speech units are highly versatile within our unified prompting framework. Not only can they serve as class labels, but they also contain rich phonetic information that can be re-synthesized back into speech signals for speech generation tasks. Specifically, we reformulate speech processing tasks into speech-to-unit generation tasks. As a result, we can seamlessly integrate tasks such as speech classification, sequence generation, and speech generation within a single, unified prompting framework. The experiment results show that the prompting method can achieve competitive performance compared to the strong fine-tuning method based on self-supervised learning models with a similar number of trainable parameters. The prompting method also shows promising results in the few-shot setting. Moreover, with the advanced speech LMs coming into the stage, the proposed prompting framework attains great potential.</p></details> | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language

| **[Language Model Can Listen While Speaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02622v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dialogue serves as the most natural manner of human-computer interaction (HCI). Recent advancements in speech language models (SLM) have significantly enhanced speech-based conversational AI. However, these models are limited to turn-based conversation, lacking the ability to interact with humans in real-time spoken scenarios, for example, being interrupted when the generated content is not satisfactory. To address these limitations, we explore full duplex modeling (FDM) in interactive speech language models (iSLM), focusing on enhancing real-time interaction and, more explicitly, exploring the quintessential ability of interruption. We introduce a novel model design, namely listening-while-speaking language model (LSLM), an end-to-end system equipped with both listening and speaking channels. Our LSLM employs a token-based decoder-only TTS for speech generation and a streaming self-supervised learning (SSL) encoder for real-time audio input. LSLM fuses both channels for autoregressive generation and detects turn-taking in real time. Three fusion strategies -- early fusion, middle fusion, and late fusion -- are explored, with middle fusion achieving an optimal balance between speech generation and real-time interaction. Two experimental settings, command-based FDM and voice-based FDM, demonstrate LSLM's robustness to noise and sensitivity to diverse instructions. Our results highlight LSLM's capability to achieve duplex communication with minimal impact on existing systems. This study aims to advance the development of interactive speech dialogue systems, enhancing their applicability in real-world contexts.</p></details> | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo can be found at https://ddlbojack.github.io/LSLM</p></details> |

Preserving emotional information in codecs is crucial for effective communication and context understanding. However, there is a lack of studies on emotion loss in existing codecs. This paper evaluates neural and legacy codecs using subjective and objective methods on emotion datasets like IEMOCAP. Our study identifies which codecs best preserve emotional information under various bitrate scenarios. We found that training codec models with both English and Chinese data had limited success in retaining emotional information in Chinese. Additionally, resynthesizing speech through these codecs degrades the performance of speech emotion recognition (SER), particularly for emotions like sadness, depression, fear, and disgust. Human listening tests confirmed these findings. This work guides future speech technology developments to ensure new codecs maintain the integrity of emotional information in speech.</p></details> | 2024-07-30 |  |
