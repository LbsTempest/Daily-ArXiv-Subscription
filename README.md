| **[Simple and Effective Unsupervised Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02524v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the first unsupervised speech synthesis system based on a simple, yet effective recipe. The framework leverages recent work in unsupervised speech recognition as well as existing neural-based speech synthesis. Using only unlabeled speech audio and unlabeled text as well as a lexicon, our method enables speech synthesis without the need for a human-labeled corpus. Experiments demonstrate the unsupervised system can synthesize speech similar to a supervised counterpart in terms of naturalness and intelligibility measured by human evaluation.</p></details> | 2022-04-21 | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, equal contribution from first two authors</p></details> |
| **[Neural Speech Embeddings for Speech Synthesis Based on Deep Generative Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05814v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain-to-speech technology represents a fusion of interdisciplinary applications encompassing fields of artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, and speech synthesis. Neural representation learning based intention decoding and speech synthesis directly connects the neural activity to the means of human linguistic communication, which may greatly enhance the naturalness of communication. With the current discoveries on representation learning and the development of the speech synthesis technologies, direct translation of brain signals into speech has shown great promise. Especially, the processed input features and neural speech embeddings which are given to the neural network play a significant role in the overall performance when using deep generative models for speech generation from brain signals. In this paper, we introduce the current brain-to-speech technology with the possibility of speech synthesis from brain signals, which may ultimately facilitate innovation in non-verbal communication. Also, we perform comprehensive analysis on the neural features and neural speech embeddings underlying the neurophysiological activation while performing speech, which may play a significant role in the speech synthesis works.</p></details> | 2024-02-28 | 4 pages |

| **[Text to speech synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13891v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis is a technology that converts written text into spoken words, enabling a natural and accessible means of communication. This abstract explores the key aspects of TTS synthesis, encompassing its underlying technologies, applications, and implications for various sectors. The technology utilizes advanced algorithms and linguistic models to convert textual information into life like speech, allowing for enhanced user experiences in diverse contexts such as accessibility tools, navigation systems, and virtual assistants.

| **[ToneUnit: A Speech Discretization Approach for Tonal Language Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08989v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing speech as discretized units has numerous benefits in supporting downstream spoken language processing tasks. However, the approach has been less explored in speech synthesis of tonal languages like Mandarin Chinese. Our preliminary experiments on Chinese speech synthesis reveal the issue of "tone shift", where a synthesized speech utterance contains correct base syllables but incorrect tones. To address the issue, we propose the ToneUnit framework, which leverages annotated data with tone labels as CTC supervision to learn tone-aware discrete speech units for Mandarin Chinese speech. Our findings indicate that the discrete units acquired through the TonUnit resolve the "tone shift" issue in synthesized Chinese speech and yield favorable results in English synthesis. Moreover, the experimental results suggest that finite scalar quantization enhances the effectiveness of ToneUnit. Notably, ToneUnit can work effectively even with minimal annotated data.</p></details> | 2024-09-04 |  |
| **[Integrated Speech and Gesture Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11436v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-speech and co-speech gesture synthesis have until now been treated as separate areas by two different research communities, and applications merely stack the two technologies using a simple system-level pipeline. This can lead to modeling inefficiencies and may introduce inconsistencies that limit the achievable naturalness. We propose to instead synthesize the two modalities in a single model, a new problem we call integrated speech and gesture synthesis (ISG). We also propose a set of models modified from state-of-the-art neural speech-synthesis engines to achieve this goal. We evaluate the models in three carefully-designed user studies, two of which evaluate the synthesized speech and gesture in isolation, plus a combined study that evaluates the models like they will be used in real-world applications -- speech and gesture presented together. The results show that participants rate one of the proposed integrated synthesis models as being as good as the state-of-the-art pipeline system we compare against, in all three tests. The model is able to achieve this with faster synthesis time and greatly reduced parameter count compared to the pipeline system, illustrating some of the potential benefits of treating speech and gesture synthesis together as a single, unified problem.

| **[Analysis and Synthesis of Hypo and Hyperarticulated Speech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04136v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on the analysis and synthesis of hypo and hyperarticulated speech in the framework of HMM-based speech synthesis. First of all, a new French database matching our needs was created, which contains three identical sets, pronounced with three different degrees of articulation: neutral, hypo and hyperarticulated speech. On that basis, acoustic and phonetic analyses were performed. It is shown that the degrees of articulation significantly influence, on one hand, both vocal tract and glottal characteristics, and on the other hand, speech rate, phone durations, phone variations and the presence of glottal stops. Finally, neutral, hypo and hyperarticulated speech are synthesized using HMM-based speech synthesis and both objective and subjective tests aiming at assessing the generated speech quality are performed. These tests show that synthesized hypoarticulated speech seems to be less naturally rendered than neutral and hyperarticulated speech.</p></details> | 2020-06-09 |  |
| **[Speech Synthesis using EEG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12756v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we demonstrate speech synthesis using different electroencephalography (EEG) feature sets recently introduced in [1]. We make use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) regression model to predict acoustic features directly from EEG features. We demonstrate our results using EEG features recorded in parallel with spoken speech as well as using EEG recorded in parallel with listening utterances. We provide EEG based speech synthesis results for four subjects in this paper and our results demonstrate the feasibility of synthesizing speech directly from EEG features.</p></details> | 2020-05-05 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE ICASSP 2020</p></details> |
| **[End to End Bangla Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00500v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) system is a system where speech is synthesized from a given text following any particular approach. Concatenative synthesis, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based synthesis, Deep Learning (DL) based synthesis with multiple building blocks, etc. are the main approaches for implementing a TTS system. Here, we are presenting our deep learning-based end-to-end Bangla speech synthesis system. It has been implemented with minimal human annotation using only 3 major components (Encoder, Decoder, Post-processing net including waveform synthesis). It does not require any frontend preprocessor and Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) converter. Our model has been trained with phonetically balanced 20 hours of single speaker speech data. It has obtained a 3.79 Mean Opinion Score (MOS) on a scale of 5.0 as subjective evaluation and a 0.77 Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality(PESQ) score on a scale of [-0.5, 4.5] as objective evaluation. It is outperforming all existing non-commercial state-of-the-art Bangla TTS systems based on naturalness.</p></details> | 2021-08-03 |  |
| **[Audiovisual Speech Synthesis using Tacotron2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00620v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audiovisual speech synthesis is the problem of synthesizing a talking face while maximizing the coherency of the acoustic and visual speech. In this paper, we propose and compare two audiovisual speech synthesis systems for 3D face models. The first system is the AVTacotron2, which is an end-to-end text-to-audiovisual speech synthesizer based on the Tacotron2 architecture. AVTacotron2 converts a sequence of phonemes representing the sentence to synthesize into a sequence of acoustic features and the corresponding controllers of a face model. The output acoustic features are used to condition a WaveRNN to reconstruct the speech waveform, and the output facial controllers are used to generate the corresponding video of the talking face. The second audiovisual speech synthesis system is modular, where acoustic speech is synthesized from text using the traditional Tacotron2. The reconstructed acoustic speech signal is then used to drive the facial controls of the face model using an independently trained audio-to-facial-animation neural network. We further condition both the end-to-end and modular approaches on emotion embeddings that encode the required prosody to generate emotional audiovisual speech. We analyze the performance of the two systems and compare them to the ground truth videos using subjective evaluation tests. The end-to-end and modular systems are able to synthesize close to human-like audiovisual speech with mean opinion scores (MOS) of 4.1 and 3.9, respectively, compared to a MOS of 4.1 for the ground truth generated from professionally recorded videos. While the end-to-end system gives a better overall quality, the modular approach is more flexible and the quality of acoustic speech and visual speech synthesis is almost independent of each other.</p></details> | 2021-08-31 | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the 23rd ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Techniques and Challenges in Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07552v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim of this project was to develop and implement an English language Text-to-Speech synthesis system. This involved a study of mechanisms of human speech production, a review of techniques in speech synthesis, and analysis of tests used to evaluate the effectiveness of synthesized speech. It was determined that a diphone synthesis system was the most effective choice for the scope of this project. A method of automatically identifying and extracting diphones from prompted speech was designed, allowing for the creation of a diphone database by a speaker in less than 40 minutes. CMUdict was used to determine the pronunciation of known words. A system for smoothing the transitions between diphone recordings was designed and implemented. CMUdict was then used to train a maximum-likelihood prediction system to determine the correct pronunciation of unknown English language alphabetic words. Then, a Part Of Speech tagger was designed to find the lexical class of words within a sentence. A method of altering the pitch, duration, and volume of the produced voice over time was designed, being a combination of the TD-PSOLA algorithm and a novel approach referred to as Unvoiced Speech Duration Shifting. This minimises distortion of the voice when shifting the pitch or duration, while maximising computational efficiency by operating in the time domain. This approach was used to add correct lexical stress to vowels within words. A text tokenisation system was developed to handle arbitrary text input, allowing pronunciation of numerical input tokens and use of appropriate pauses for punctuation. Methods for further improving sentence level speech naturalness were discussed. Finally, the system was tested with listeners for its intelligibility and naturalness.</p></details> | 2017-09-25 | <details><summary>138 p...</summary><p>138 pages, 46 figures, Undergraduate Honours Thesis towards a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering, November 2016, The University of Newcastle, Australia</p></details> |
| **[MASS: Multi-task Anthropomorphic Speech Synthesis Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04124v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis plays an important role in human-computer interaction. Currently, most TTS technologies focus on the naturalness of speech, namely,making the speeches sound like humans. However, the key tasks of the expression of emotion and the speaker identity are ignored, which limits the application scenarios of TTS synthesis technology. To make the synthesized speech more realistic and expand the application scenarios, we propose a multi-task anthropomorphic speech synthesis framework (MASS), which can synthesize speeches from text with specified emotion and speaker identity. The MASS framework consists of a base TTS module and two novel voice conversion modules: the emotional voice conversion module and the speaker voice conversion module. We propose deep emotion voice conversion model (DEVC) and deep speaker voice conversion model (DSVC) based on convolution residual networks. It solves the problem of feature loss during voice conversion. The model trainings are independent of parallel datasets, and are capable of many-to-many voice conversion. In the emotional voice conversion, speaker voice conversion experiments, as well as the multi-task speech synthesis experiments, experimental results show DEVC and DSVC convert speech effectively. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation results of multi-task speech synthesis experiments show MASS can effectively synthesis speech with specified text, emotion and speaker identity.</p></details> | 2021-05-11 |  |
| **[FlashSpeech: Efficient Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14700v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis has been significantly advanced by language models and diffusion models. However, the generation process of both methods is slow and computationally intensive. Efficient speech synthesis using a lower computing budget to achieve quality on par with previous work remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present FlashSpeech, a large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis system with approximately 5\% of the inference time compared with previous work. FlashSpeech is built on the latent consistency model and applies a novel adversarial consistency training approach that can train from scratch without the need for a pre-trained diffusion model as the teacher. Furthermore, a new prosody generator module enhances the diversity of prosody, making the rhythm of the speech sound more natural. The generation processes of FlashSpeech can be achieved efficiently with one or two sampling steps while maintaining high audio quality and high similarity to the audio prompt for zero-shot speech generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of FlashSpeech. Notably, FlashSpeech can be about 20 times faster than other zero-shot speech synthesis systems while maintaining comparable performance in terms of voice quality and similarity. Furthermore, FlashSpeech demonstrates its versatility by efficiently performing tasks like voice conversion, speech editing, and diverse speech sampling. Audio samples can be found in https://flashspeech.github.io/.</p></details> | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Effic...</summary><p>Efficient zero-shot speech synthesis</p></details> |
| **[Deep Speech Synthesis from Articulatory Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06337v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the articulatory synthesis task, speech is synthesized from input features containing information about the physical behavior of the human vocal tract. This task provides a promising direction for speech synthesis research, as the articulatory space is compact, smooth, and interpretable. Current works have highlighted the potential for deep learning models to perform articulatory synthesis. However, it remains unclear whether these models can achieve the efficiency and fidelity of the human speech production system. To help bridge this gap, we propose a time-domain articulatory synthesis methodology and demonstrate its efficacy with both electromagnetic articulography (EMA) and synthetic articulatory feature inputs. Our model is computationally efficient and achieves a transcription word error rate (WER) of 18.5% for the EMA-to-speech task, yielding an improvement of 11.6% compared to prior work. Through interpolation experiments, we also highlight the generalizability and interpretability of our approach.</p></details> | 2022-09-15 |  |
| **[MSceneSpeech: A Multi-Scene Speech Dataset For Expressive Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14006v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an open source high-quality Mandarin TTS dataset MSceneSpeech (Multiple Scene Speech Dataset), which is intended to provide resources for expressive speech synthesis. MSceneSpeech comprises numerous audio recordings and texts performed and recorded according to daily life scenarios. Each scenario includes multiple speakers and a diverse range of prosodic styles, making it suitable for speech synthesis that entails multi-speaker style and prosody modeling. We have established a robust baseline, through the prompting mechanism, that can effectively synthesize speech characterized by both user-specific timbre and scene-specific prosody with arbitrary text input. The open source MSceneSpeech Dataset and audio samples of our baseline are available at https://speechai-demo.github.io/MSceneSpeech/.</p></details> | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Text-to-Speech Synthesis by Unsupervised Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15796v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An unsupervised text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) system learns to generate speech waveforms corresponding to any written sentence in a language by observing: 1) a collection of untranscribed speech waveforms in that language; 2) a collection of texts written in that language without access to any transcribed speech. Developing such a system can significantly improve the availability of speech technology to languages without a large amount of parallel speech and text data. This paper proposes an unsupervised TTS system based on an alignment module that outputs pseudo-text and another synthesis module that uses pseudo-text for training and real text for inference. Our unsupervised system can achieve comparable performance to the supervised system in seven languages with about 10-20 hours of speech each. A careful study on the effect of text units and vocoders has also been conducted to better understand what factors may affect unsupervised TTS performance. The samples generated by our models can be found at https://cactuswiththoughts.github.io/UnsupTTS-Demo, and our code can be found at https://github.com/lwang114/UnsupTTS.</p></details> | 2022-08-17 | INTERSPEECH 2022 |
| **[Speech Synthesis as Augmentation for Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13004v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech synthesis might hold the key to low-resource speech recognition. Data augmentation techniques have become an essential part of modern speech recognition training. Yet, they are simple, naive, and rarely reflect real-world conditions. Meanwhile, speech synthesis techniques have been rapidly getting closer to the goal of achieving human-like speech. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using synthesized speech as a form of data augmentation to lower the resources necessary to build a speech recognizer. We experiment with three different kinds of synthesizers: statistical parametric, neural, and adversarial. Our findings are interesting and point to new research directions for the future.</p></details> | 2020-12-25 |  |
| **[Accurate synthesis of Dysarthric Speech for ASR data augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08438v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder often characterized by reduced speech intelligibility through slow, uncoordinated control of speech production muscles. Automatic Speech recognition (ASR) systems can help dysarthric talkers communicate more effectively. However, robust dysarthria-specific ASR requires a significant amount of training speech, which is not readily available for dysarthric talkers. This paper presents a new dysarthric speech synthesis method for the purpose of ASR training data augmentation. Differences in prosodic and acoustic characteristics of dysarthric spontaneous speech at varying severity levels are important components for dysarthric speech modeling, synthesis, and augmentation. For dysarthric speech synthesis, a modified neural multi-talker TTS is implemented by adding a dysarthria severity level coefficient and a pause insertion model to synthesize dysarthric speech for varying severity levels. To evaluate the effectiveness for synthesis of training data for ASR, dysarthria-specific speech recognition was used. Results show that a DNN-HMM model trained on additional synthetic dysarthric speech achieves WER improvement of 12.2% compared to the baseline, and that the addition of the severity level and pause insertion controls decrease WER by 6.5%, showing the effectiveness of adding these parameters. Overall results on the TORGO database demonstrate that using dysarthric synthetic speech to increase the amount of dysarthric-patterned speech for training has significant impact on the dysarthric ASR systems. In addition, we have conducted a subjective evaluation to evaluate the dysarthric-ness and similarity of synthesized speech. Our subjective evaluation shows that the perceived dysartrhic-ness of synthesized speech is similar to that of true dysarthric speech, especially for higher levels of dysarthria</p></details> | 2023-08-17 | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2201.11571</p></details> |
| **[On-device neural speech synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08710v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, such as Tacotron and WaveRNN, have made it possible to construct a fully neural network based TTS system, by coupling the two components together. Such a system is conceptually simple as it only takes grapheme or phoneme input, uses Mel-spectrogram as an intermediate feature, and directly generates speech samples. The system achieves quality equal or close to natural speech. However, the high computational cost of the system and issues with robustness have limited their usage in real-world speech synthesis applications and products. In this paper, we present key modeling improvements and optimization strategies that enable deploying these models, not only on GPU servers, but also on mobile devices. The proposed system can generate high-quality 24 kHz speech at 5x faster than real time on server and 3x faster than real time on mobile devices.</p></details> | 2021-09-21 | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages 2 figures, accepted to ASRU 2021</p></details> |
| **[Embedding a Differentiable Mel-cepstral Synthesis Filter to a Neural Speech Synthesis System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11222v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper integrates a classic mel-cepstral synthesis filter into a modern neural speech synthesis system towards end-to-end controllable speech synthesis. Since the mel-cepstral synthesis filter is explicitly embedded in neural waveform models in the proposed system, both voice characteristics and the pitch of synthesized speech are highly controlled via a frequency warping parameter and fundamental frequency, respectively. We implement the mel-cepstral synthesis filter as a differentiable and GPU-friendly module to enable the acoustic and waveform models in the proposed system to be simultaneously optimized in an end-to-end manner. Experiments show that the proposed system improves speech quality from a baseline system maintaining controllability. The core PyTorch modules used in the experiments will be publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> | 2022-11-22 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2023</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-Scale Style Control for Expressive Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03521v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a multi-scale speech style modeling method for end-to-end expressive speech synthesis. The proposed method employs a multi-scale reference encoder to extract both the global-scale utterance-level and the local-scale quasi-phoneme-level style features of the target speech, which are then fed into the speech synthesis model as an extension to the input phoneme sequence. During training time, the multi-scale style model could be jointly trained with the speech synthesis model in an end-to-end fashion. By applying the proposed method to style transfer task, experimental results indicate that the controllability of the multi-scale speech style model and the expressiveness of the synthesized speech are greatly improved. Moreover, by assigning different reference speeches to extraction of style on each scale, the flexibility of the proposed method is further revealed.</p></details> | 2021-04-09 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to INTERSPEECH 2021</p></details> |
| **[A Bengali HMM Based Speech Synthesis System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3915v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper presents the capability of an HMM-based TTS system to produce Bengali speech. In this synthesis method, trajectories of speech parameters are generated from the trained Hidden Markov Models. A final speech waveform is synthesized from those speech parameters. In our experiments, spectral properties were represented by Mel Cepstrum Coefficients. Both the training and synthesis issues are investigated in this paper using annotated Bengali speech database. Experimental evaluation depicts that the developed text-to-speech system is capable of producing adequately natural speech in terms of intelligibility and intonation for Bengali.</p></details> | 2014-06-17 |  |
| **[Comprehensive evaluation of statistical speech waveform synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06296v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical TTS systems that directly predict the speech waveform have recently reported improvements in synthesis quality. This investigation evaluates Amazon's statistical speech waveform synthesis (SSWS) system. An in-depth evaluation of SSWS is conducted across a number of domains to better understand the consistency in quality. The results of this evaluation are validated by repeating the procedure on a separate group of testers. Finally, an analysis of the nature of speech errors of SSWS compared to hybrid unit selection synthesis is conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of SSWS. Having a deeper insight into SSWS allows us to better define the focus of future work to improve this new technology.</p></details> | 2018-12-12 |  |
| **[Improving robustness of spontaneous speech synthesis with linguistic speech regularization and pseudo-filled-pause insertion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09815v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a training method with linguistic speech regularization that improves the robustness of spontaneous speech synthesis methods with filled pause (FP) insertion. Spontaneous speech synthesis is aimed at producing speech with human-like disfluencies, such as FPs. Because modeling the complex data distribution of spontaneous speech with a rich FP vocabulary is challenging, the quality of FP-inserted synthetic speech is often limited. To address this issue, we present a method for synthesizing spontaneous speech that improves robustness to diverse FP insertions. Regularization is used to stabilize the synthesis of the linguistic speech (i.e., non-FP) elements. To further improve robustness to diverse FP insertions, it utilizes pseudo-FPs sampled using an FP word prediction model as well as ground-truth FPs. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed method improves the naturalness of synthetic speech with ground-truth and predicted FPs by 0.24 and 0.26, respectively.</p></details> | 2023-09-20 | Accepted to SSW12 |
| **[Macedonian Speech Synthesis for Assistive Technology Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09198v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech technology is becoming ever more ubiquitous with the advance of speech enabled devices and services. The use of speech synthesis in Augmentative and Alternative Communication tools, has facilitated inclusion of individuals with speech impediments allowing them to communicate with their surroundings using speech. Although there are numerous speech synthesis systems for the most spoken world languages, there is still a limited offer for smaller languages. We propose and compare three models built using parametric and deep learning techniques for Macedonian trained on a newly recorded corpus. We target low-resource edge deployment for Augmentative and Alternative Communication and assistive technologies, such as communication boards and screen readers. The listening test results show that parametric speech synthesis is as performant compared to the more advanced deep learning models. Since it also requires less resources, and offers full speech rate and pitch control, it is the preferred choice for building a Macedonian TTS system for this application scenario.</p></details> | 2023-06-06 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, EUSIPCO conference 2022</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Stage Framework for Multimodal Controllable Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20945v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable speech synthesis aims to control the style of generated speech using reference input, which can be of various modalities. Existing face-based methods struggle with robustness and generalization due to data quality constraints, while text prompt methods offer limited diversity and fine-grained control. Although multimodal approaches aim to integrate various modalities, their reliance on fully matched training data significantly constrains their performance and applicability. This paper proposes a 3-stage multimodal controllable speech synthesis framework to address these challenges. For face encoder, we use supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle generalization issues. Furthermore, the text encoder is trained on both text-face and text-speech data to enhance the diversity of the generated speech. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms single-modal baseline methods in both face based and text prompt based speech synthesis, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality speech.</p></details> | 2025-06-27 | Accepted by ICME2025 |
| **[Audio-visual video-to-speech synthesis with synthesized input audio](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16584v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-to-speech synthesis involves reconstructing the speech signal of a speaker from a silent video. The implicit assumption of this task is that the sound signal is either missing or contains a high amount of noise/corruption such that it is not useful for processing. Previous works in the literature either use video inputs only or employ both video and audio inputs during training, and discard the input audio pathway during inference. In this work we investigate the effect of using video and audio inputs for video-to-speech synthesis during both training and inference. In particular, we use pre-trained video-to-speech models to synthesize the missing speech signals and then train an audio-visual-to-speech synthesis model, using both the silent video and the synthesized speech as inputs, to predict the final reconstructed speech. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is successful with both raw waveforms and mel spectrograms as target outputs.</p></details> | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Analysing Shortcomings of Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10941v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Output from statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) remains noticeably worse than natural speech recordings in terms of quality, naturalness, speaker similarity, and intelligibility in noise. There are many hypotheses regarding the origins of these shortcomings, but these hypotheses are often kept vague and presented without empirical evidence that could confirm and quantify how a specific shortcoming contributes to imperfections in the synthesised speech. Throughout speech synthesis literature, surprisingly little work is dedicated towards identifying the perceptually most important problems in speech synthesis, even though such knowledge would be of great value for creating better SPSS systems. In this book chapter, we analyse some of the shortcomings of SPSS. In particular, we discuss issues with vocoding and present a general methodology for quantifying the effect of any of the many assumptions and design choices that hold SPSS back. The methodology is accompanied by an example that carefully measures and compares the severity of perceptual limitations imposed by vocoding as well as other factors such as the statistical model and its use.</p></details> | 2018-07-31 | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages with 4 figures; draft book chapter</p></details> |
| **[Intelligible Lip-to-Speech Synthesis with Speech Units](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19603v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel Lip-to-Speech synthesis (L2S) framework, for synthesizing intelligible speech from a silent lip movement video. Specifically, to complement the insufficient supervisory signal of the previous L2S model, we propose to use quantized self-supervised speech representations, named speech units, as an additional prediction target for the L2S model. Therefore, the proposed L2S model is trained to generate multiple targets, mel-spectrogram and speech units. As the speech units are discrete while mel-spectrogram is continuous, the proposed multi-target L2S model can be trained with strong content supervision, without using text-labeled data. Moreover, to accurately convert the synthesized mel-spectrogram into a waveform, we introduce a multi-input vocoder that can generate a clear waveform even from blurry and noisy mel-spectrogram by referring to the speech units. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in L2S.</p></details> | 2023-06-01 | Interspeech 2023 |
| **[Evaluating Speech Synthesis by Training Recognizers on Synthetic Speech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00706v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern speech synthesis systems have improved significantly, with synthetic speech being indistinguishable from real speech. However, efficient and holistic evaluation of synthetic speech still remains a significant challenge. Human evaluation using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is ideal, but inefficient due to high costs. Therefore, researchers have developed auxiliary automatic metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to measure intelligibility. Prior works focus on evaluating synthetic speech based on pre-trained speech recognition models, however, this can be limiting since this approach primarily measures speech intelligibility. In this paper, we propose an evaluation technique involving the training of an ASR model on synthetic speech and assessing its performance on real speech. Our main assumption is that by training the ASR model on the synthetic speech, the WER on real speech reflects the similarity between distributions, a broader assessment of synthetic speech quality beyond intelligibility. Our proposed metric demonstrates a strong correlation with both MOS naturalness and MOS intelligibility when compared to SpeechLMScore and MOSNet on three recent Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems: MQTTS, StyleTTS, and YourTTS.</p></details> | 2023-10-03 |  |
| **[Deep Feed-forward Sequential Memory Networks for Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09194v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) RNN based speech synthesis system is among the best parametric Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems in terms of the naturalness of generated speech, especially the naturalness in prosody. However, the model complexity and inference cost of BLSTM prevents its usage in many runtime applications. Meanwhile, Deep Feed-forward Sequential Memory Networks (DFSMN) has shown its consistent out-performance over BLSTM in both word error rate (WER) and the runtime computation cost in speech recognition tasks. Since speech synthesis also requires to model long-term dependencies compared to speech recognition, in this paper, we investigate the Deep-FSMN (DFSMN) in speech synthesis. Both objective and subjective experiments show that, compared with BLSTM TTS method, the DFSMN system can generate synthesized speech with comparable speech quality while drastically reduce model complexity and speech generation time.</p></details> | 2018-02-27 | 5 pages, ICASSP 2018 |

Recent advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning, facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech technologies.</p></details> | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

However, for a particular language like Hindi, which is a highly confusing language (due to very close spellings), it is not an easy task to identify errors/mistakes in input text and an incorrect text degrade the quality of output speech hence this paper is a contribution to the development of high quality speech synthesis with the involvement of Spellchecker which generates spell suggestions for misspelled words automatically. Involvement of spellchecker would increase the efficiency of speech synthesis by providing spell suggestions for incorrect input text. Furthermore, we have provided the comparative study for evaluating the resultant effect on to phonetic text by adding spellchecker on to input text.</p></details> | 2014-02-19 | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Disentanglement in a GAN for Unconditional Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01673v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can we develop a model that can synthesize realistic speech directly from a latent space, without explicit conditioning? Despite several efforts over the last decade, previous adversarial and diffusion-based approaches still struggle to achieve this, even on small-vocabulary datasets. To address this, we propose AudioStyleGAN (ASGAN) -- a generative adversarial network for unconditional speech synthesis tailored to learn a disentangled latent space. Building upon the StyleGAN family of image synthesis models, ASGAN maps sampled noise to a disentangled latent vector which is then mapped to a sequence of audio features so that signal aliasing is suppressed at every layer. To successfully train ASGAN, we introduce a number of new techniques, including a modification to adaptive discriminator augmentation which probabilistically skips discriminator updates. We apply it on the small-vocabulary Google Speech Commands digits dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in unconditional speech synthesis. It is also substantially faster than existing top-performing diffusion models. We confirm that ASGAN's latent space is disentangled: we demonstrate how simple linear operations in the space can be used to perform several tasks unseen during training. Specifically, we perform evaluations in voice conversion, speech enhancement, speaker verification, and keyword classification. Our work indicates that GANs are still highly competitive in the unconditional speech synthesis landscape, and that disentangled latent spaces can be used to aid generalization to unseen tasks.

Unlike existing methods, KALL-E directly models the continuous speech distribution conditioned on text, eliminating the need for any diffusion-based components. Specifically, we utilize a Flow-VAE to extract a continuous latent speech representation from waveforms, instead of relying on discrete speech tokens. A single AR Transformer is then trained to predict these continuous speech distributions from text, optimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss as its objective. Experimental results demonstrate that KALL-E achieves superior speech synthesis quality and can even adapt to a target speaker from just a single sample. Importantly, KALL-E provides a more direct and effective approach for utilizing continuous speech representations in TTS.</p></details> | 2025-09-18 | 6 figures, 5 tables |

One of the most remarkable features of TTS synthesis is its capability to produce speech in the voice of different speakers. This paper introduces voice cloning and speech synthesis https://pypi.org/project/voice-cloning/ an open-source python package for helping speech disorders to communicate more effectively as well as for professionals seeking to integrate voice cloning or speech synthesis capabilities into their projects. This package aims to generate synthetic speech that sounds like the natural voice of an individual, but it does not replace the natural human voice. The architecture of the system comprises a speaker verification system, a synthesizer, a vocoder, and noise reduction. Speaker verification system trained on a varied set of speakers to achieve optimal generalization performance without relying on transcriptions. Synthesizer is trained using both audio and transcriptions that generate Mel spectrogram from a text and vocoder which converts the generated Mel Spectrogram into corresponding audio signal. Then the audio signal is processed by a noise reduction algorithm to eliminate unwanted noise and enhance speech clarity. The performance of synthesized speech from seen and unseen speakers are then evaluated using subjective and objective evaluation such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Gross Pitch Error (GPE), and Spectral distortion (SD). The model can create speech in distinct voices by including speaker characteristics that are chosen randomly.</p></details> | 2024-02-19 |  |

Nevertheless, while state-of-the-art, data-driven approaches to facial animation can make use of sophisticated motion capture techniques, the animation of the intraoral articulators (viz. the tongue, jaw, and velum) typically makes use of simple rules or viseme morphing, in stark contrast to the otherwise high quality of facial modeling. Using appropriate speech production data could significantly improve the quality of articulatory animation for AV synthesis.</p></details> | 2012-09-25 |  |

In this study, we investigate how text-to-speech synthesis techniques can be used for piano MIDI-to-audio synthesis tasks. Our investigation includes Tacotron and neural source-filter waveform models as the basic components, with which we build MIDI-to-audio synthesis systems in similar ways to TTS frameworks. We also include reference systems using conventional sound modeling techniques such as sample-based and physical-modeling-based methods. The subjective experimental results demonstrate that the investigated TTS components can be applied to piano MIDI-to-audio synthesis with minor modifications. The results also reveal the performance bottleneck -- while the waveform model can synthesize high quality piano sound given natural acoustic features, the conversion from MIDI to acoustic features is challenging. The full MIDI-to-audio synthesis system is still inferior to the sample-based or physical-modeling-based approaches, but we encourage TTS researchers to test their TTS models for this new task and improve the performance.</p></details> | 2022-02-25 | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the proceedings of ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop 2021</p></details> |

Due to the high complexity of this problem, we approach it as the composition of two problems. Specifically, that of Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis as well as the voice-driven talking head animation. For TTS, we present models that are used to map text to intermediate acoustic representations, e.g. mel-spectrograms, as well as models that generate voice signals conditioned on these intermediate representations, i.e vocoders. For the talking-head animation problem, we categorize approaches based on whether they produce human faces or anthropomorphic figures. An attempt is also made to discuss the importance of the choice of facial models in the second case. Throughout the review, we briefly describe the most important work in audiovisual speech synthesis, trying to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches.</p></details> | 2021-03-09 | <details><summary>revie...</summary><p>review is written in Greek</p></details> |

The technique allows us to automatically extract low-dimensional features from high dimensional spectral features in a non-linear, data-driven, unsupervised way.

| **[CosyVoice 2: Scalable Streaming Speech Synthesis with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10117v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our previous work, we introduced CosyVoice, a multilingual speech synthesis model based on supervised discrete speech tokens. By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode.

| **[Environment Aware Text-to-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03887v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims at designing an environment-aware text-to-speech (TTS) system that can generate speech to suit specific acoustic environments. It is also motivated by the desire to leverage massive data of speech audio from heterogeneous sources in TTS system development. The key idea is to model the acoustic environment in speech audio as a factor of data variability and incorporate it as a condition in the process of neural network based speech synthesis. Two embedding extractors are trained with two purposely constructed datasets for characterization and disentanglement of speaker and environment factors in speech. A neural network model is trained to generate speech from extracted speaker and environment embeddings. Objective and subjective evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed TTS system is able to effectively disentangle speaker and environment factors and synthesize speech audio that carries designated speaker characteristics and environment attribute. Audio samples are available online for demonstration https://daxintan-cuhk.github.io/Environment-Aware-TTS/ .</p></details> | 2022-08-09 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2022</p></details> |
| **[Speaker-Independent Speech-Driven Visual Speech Synthesis using Domain-Adapted Acoustic Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06860v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech-driven visual speech synthesis involves mapping features extracted from acoustic speech to the corresponding lip animation controls for a face model. This mapping can take many forms, but a powerful approach is to use deep neural networks (DNNs). However, a limitation is the lack of synchronized audio, video, and depth data required to reliably train the DNNs, especially for speaker-independent models. In this paper, we investigate adapting an automatic speech recognition (ASR) acoustic model (AM) for the visual speech synthesis problem. We train the AM on ten thousand hours of audio-only data. The AM is then adapted to the visual speech synthesis domain using ninety hours of synchronized audio-visual speech. Using a subjective assessment test, we compared the performance of the AM-initialized DNN to one with a random initialization. The results show that viewers significantly prefer animations generated from the AM-initialized DNN than the ones generated using the randomly initialized model. We conclude that visual speech synthesis can significantly benefit from the powerful representation of speech in the ASR acoustic models.</p></details> | 2019-05-17 | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The time required for the same is known as synthesis delay. In this paper, an approach to reduce speech synthesis delay has been proposed. It aims to enhance the TTS systems for real-time applications such as digital assistants, mobile phones, embedded devices, etc. The proposed approach applies Fast Griffin Lim Algorithm (FGLA) instead Griffin Lim algorithm (GLA) as vocoder in the speech synthesis phase. GLA and FGLA are both iterative, but the convergence rate of FGLA is faster than GLA. The proposed approach is tested on LJSpeech, Blizzard and Tatoeba datasets and the results for FGLA are compared against GLA and neural Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based vocoder. The performance is evaluated based on synthesis delay and speech quality. A 36.58% reduction in speech synthesis delay has been observed. The quality of the output speech has improved, which is advocated by higher Mean opinion scores (MOS) and faster convergence with FGLA as opposed to GLA.</p></details> | 2020-07-14 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Springer Multimedia Tools and Applications Journal</p></details> |

Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.</p></details> | 2017-04-10 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Interspeech 2017. v2 changed paper title to be consistent with our conference submission (no content change other than typo fixes)</p></details> |

In recent years, machines have managed to master the art of generating speech that is understandable by humans. But the linguistic content of an utterance encompasses only a part of its meaning. Affect, or expressivity, has the capacity to turn speech into a medium capable of conveying intimate thoughts, feelings, and emotions -- aspects that are essential for engaging and naturalistic interpersonal communication. While the goal of imparting expressivity to synthesised utterances has so far remained elusive, following recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis, a paradigm shift is well under way in the fields of affective speech synthesis and conversion as well. Deep learning, as the technology which underlies most of the recent advances in artificial intelligence, is spearheading these efforts. In the present overview, we outline ongoing trends and summarise state-of-the-art approaches in an attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of this exciting field.</p></details> | 2023-03-14 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of IEEE</p></details> |

We demonstrate that LPCNet can achieve significantly higher quality than WaveRNN for the same network size and that high quality LPCNet speech synthesis is achievable with a complexity under 3 GFLOPS. This makes it easier to deploy neural synthesis applications on lower-power devices, such as embedded systems and mobile phones.</p></details> | 2019-02-20 | ICASSP 2019, 5 pages |

With the success of reading-style speech synthesis, the research target is shifting to tasks that use complicated contexts. Audiobook speech synthesis is a good example that requires cross-sentence, expressiveness, etc. Unlike reading-style speech, speaker-specific expressiveness in audiobook speech also becomes the context. To enhance this research, we propose a method of constructing a corpus from audiobooks read by professional speakers. From many audiobooks and their texts, our method can automatically extract and refine the data without any language dependency. Specifically, we use vocal-instrumental separation to extract clean data, connectionist temporal classification to roughly align text and audio, and voice activity detection to refine the alignment. J-MAC is open-sourced in our project page. We also conduct audiobook speech synthesis evaluations, and the results give insights into audiobook speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2022-01-27 |  |

This is sometimes called "unsupervised speaker adaptation". More specifically, we concatenate the layers to the audio inputs when performing unsupervised speaker adaptation while we concatenate them to the text inputs when synthesizing speech from text. Two new training schemes for the new architecture are also proposed in this paper. These training schemes are not limited to speech synthesis, other applications are suggested. Experimental results show that the proposed model not only enables adaptation to unseen speakers using untranscribed speech but it also improves the performance of multi-speaker modeling and speaker adaptation using transcribed audio files.</p></details> | 2018-08-21 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Interspeech 2018, India</p></details> |

Unfortunately the delivered quality suffers from a typical buzziness due to the fact that speech is vocoded. This paper proposes a new excitation model in order to reduce this undesirable effect. This model is based on the decomposition of pitch-synchronous residual frames on an orthonormal basis obtained by Principal Component Analysis. This basis contains a limited number of eigenresiduals and is computed on a relatively small speech database. A stream of PCA-based coefficients is added to our HMM-based synthesizer and allows to generate the voiced excitation during the synthesis. An improvement compared to the traditional excitation is reported while the synthesis engine footprint remains under about 1Mb.</p></details> | 2020-01-06 |  |

The current studies are mostly focused on imitating an averaged style belonging to a specific emotion type. In this paper, we seek to generate speech with a mixture of emotions at run-time. We propose a novel formulation that measures the relative difference between the speech samples of different emotions. We then incorporate our formulation into a sequence-to-sequence emotional text-to-speech framework. During the training, the framework does not only explicitly characterize emotion styles, but also explores the ordinal nature of emotions by quantifying the differences with other emotions. At run-time, we control the model to produce the desired emotion mixture by manually defining an emotion attribute vector. The objective and subjective evaluations have validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. To our best knowledge, this research is the first study on modelling, synthesizing, and evaluating mixed emotions in speech.</p></details> | 2023-01-02 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Watermarking for Adversarial Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15224v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in neural speech synthesis have brought us technology that is not only close to human naturalness, but is also capable of instant voice cloning with little data, and is highly accessible with pre-trained models available. Naturally, the potential flood of generated content raises the need for synthetic speech detection and watermarking. Recently, considerable research effort in synthetic speech detection has been related to the Automatic Speaker Verification and Spoofing Countermeasure Challenge (ASVspoof), which focuses on passive countermeasures. This paper takes a complementary view to generated speech detection: a synthesis system should make an active effort to watermark the generated speech in a way that aids detection by another machine, but remains transparent to a human listener. We propose a collaborative training scheme for synthetic speech watermarking and show that a HiFi-GAN neural vocoder collaborating with the ASVspoof 2021 baseline countermeasure models consistently improves detection performance over conventional classifier training. Furthermore, we demonstrate how collaborative training can be paired with augmentation strategies for added robustness against noise and time-stretching. Finally, listening tests demonstrate that collaborative training has little adverse effect on perceptual quality of vocoded speech.</p></details> | 2024-01-03 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024</p></details> |

| **[An Empirical Study of Speech Language Models for Prompt-Conditioned Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12402v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech language models (LMs) are promising for high-quality speech synthesis through in-context learning. A typical speech LM takes discrete semantic units as content and a short utterance as prompt, and synthesizes speech which preserves the content's semantics but mimics the prompt's style. However, there is no systematic understanding on how the synthesized audio is controlled by the prompt and content. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the widely used autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) speech LMs and provide insights into the prompt design and content semantic units. Our analysis reveals that heterogeneous and nonstationary prompts hurt the audio quality in contrast to the previous finding that longer prompts always lead to better synthesis. Moreover, we find that the speaker style of the synthesized audio is also affected by the content in addition to the prompt. We further show that semantic units carry rich acoustic information such as pitch, tempo, volume and speech emphasis, which might be leaked from the content to the synthesized audio.</p></details> | 2024-03-20 |  |
| **[Accelerating Autoregressive Speech Synthesis Inference With Speech Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15380v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern autoregressive speech synthesis models leveraging language models have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, the sequential nature of next token prediction in these models leads to significant latency, hindering their deployment in scenarios where inference speed is critical. In this work, we propose Speech Speculative Decoding (SSD), a novel framework for autoregressive speech synthesis acceleration. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight draft model to generate candidate token sequences, which are subsequently verified in parallel by the target model using the proposed SSD framework. Experimental results demonstrate that SSD achieves a significant speedup of 1.4x compared with conventional autoregressive decoding, while maintaining high fidelity and naturalness. Subjective evaluations further validate the effectiveness of SSD in preserving the perceptual quality of the target model while accelerating inference.</p></details> | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

In particular, speech synthesis systems are popular in different applications, such as personal assistants, GPS applications, screen readers and accessibility tools. However, not all languages are on the same level when in terms of resources and systems for speech synthesis. This work consists of creating publicly available resources for Brazilian Portuguese in the form of a novel dataset along with deep learning models for end-to-end speech synthesis. Such dataset has 10.5 hours from a single speaker, from which a Tacotron 2 model with the RTISI-LA vocoder presented the best performance, achieving a 4.03 MOS value. The obtained results are comparable to related works covering English language and the state-of-the-art in Portuguese.</p></details> | 2022-02-01 |  |

In this work we move towards a speech synthesis system that can produce diverse speech renditions of a text by allowing (but not requiring) explicit control over the various factors of variation. We propose a new neural vocoder that offers control of such factors of variation. This is achieved by employing differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) (previously used only for music rather than speech), which exposes these factors of variation. The results show that the proposed approach can produce natural speech with realistic timbre, and individual factors of variation can be freely controlled.</p></details> | 2020-10-29 | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, for associated audio files, see https://thesmith1.github.io/DDSPeech/</p></details> |

| **[Boosting Large Language Model for Speech Synthesis: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00246v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language processing and are concurrently extending the language ability to other modalities, such as speech and vision. Nevertheless, most of the previous work focuses on prompting LLMs with perception abilities like auditory comprehension, and the effective approach for augmenting LLMs with speech synthesis capabilities remains ambiguous. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical exploration of boosting LLMs with the ability to generate speech, by combining pre-trained LLM LLaMA/OPT and text-to-speech synthesis model VALL-E. We compare three integration methods between LLMs and speech synthesis models, including directly fine-tuned LLMs, superposed layers of LLMs and VALL-E, and coupled LLMs and VALL-E using LLMs as a powerful text encoder. Experimental results show that, using LoRA method to fine-tune LLMs directly to boost the speech synthesis capability does not work well, and superposed LLMs and VALL-E can improve the quality of generated speech both in speaker similarity and word error rate (WER). Among these three methods, coupled methods leveraging LLMs as the text encoder can achieve the best performance, making it outperform original speech synthesis models with a consistently better speaker similarity and a significant (10.9%) WER reduction.</p></details> | 2024-01-02 |  |

However, a critical challenge is the inherent intricate one-to-many mapping between speech and gestures. Previous studies have explored and achieved significant progress with generative models. Notwithstanding, most synthetic gestures are still vastly less natural. This paper presents DiffMotion, a novel speech-driven gesture synthesis architecture based on diffusion models. The model comprises an autoregressive temporal encoder and a denoising diffusion probability Module. The encoder extracts the temporal context of the speech input and historical gestures. The diffusion module learns a parameterized Markov chain to gradually convert a simple distribution into a complex distribution and generates the gestures according to the accompanied speech. Compared with baselines, objective and subjective evaluations confirm that our approach can produce natural and diverse gesticulation and demonstrate the benefits of diffusion-based models on speech-driven gesture synthesis.</p></details> | 2023-02-03 | 13 pages, 3 figures |

We modify the input and output layer structures of the network to improve the performance. For the linguistic features, we apply a feature grouping strategy to enhance emotional and prosodic features. The acoustic parameters are designed to be suitable for the regression task and waveform reconstruction. EMPHASIS can synthesize speech in real-time and generate expressive interrogative and exclamatory speech with high audio quality. EMPHASIS is designed to be a multi-lingual model and can synthesize Mandarin-English speech for now. In the experiment of emotional speech synthesis, it achieves better subjective results than other real-time speech synthesis systems.</p></details> | 2018-06-27 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2018</p></details> |
| **[CrossSpeech++: Cross-lingual Speech Synthesis with Decoupled Language and Speaker Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20048v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this work is to generate natural speech in multiple languages while maintaining the same speaker identity, a task known as cross-lingual speech synthesis. A key challenge of cross-lingual speech synthesis is the language-speaker entanglement problem, which causes the quality of cross-lingual systems to lag behind that of intra-lingual systems. In this paper, we propose CrossSpeech++, which effectively disentangles language and speaker information and significantly improves the quality of cross-lingual speech synthesis. To this end, we break the complex speech generation pipeline into two simple components: language-dependent and speaker-dependent generators. The language-dependent generator produces linguistic variations that are not biased by specific speaker attributes. The speaker-dependent generator models acoustic variations that characterize speaker identity. By handling each type of information in separate modules, our method can effectively disentangle language and speaker representation. We conduct extensive experiments using various metrics, and demonstrate that CrossSpeech++ achieves significant improvements in cross-lingual speech synthesis, outperforming existing methods by a large margin.</p></details> | 2024-12-31 |  |

Speech synthesis research focuses traditionally on text-to-speech conversion, when the input is text or an estimated linguistic representation, and the target is synthesized speech. However, a research field that has risen in the last decade is articulation-to-speech synthesis (with a target application of a Silent Speech Interface, SSI), when the goal is to synthesize speech from some representation of the movement of the articulatory organs. In this paper, we extend traditional (vocoder-based) DNN-TTS with articulatory input, estimated from ultrasound tongue images. We compare text-only, ultrasound-only, and combined inputs. Using data from eight speakers, we show that that the combined text and articulatory input can have advantages in limited-data scenarios, namely, it may increase the naturalness of synthesized speech compared to single text input. Besides, we analyze the ultrasound tongue recordings of several speakers, and show that misalignments in the ultrasound transducer positioning can have a negative effect on the final synthesis performance.</p></details> | 2021-07-06 | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at SSW11 (11th Speech Synthesis Workshop)</p></details> |

Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

| **[Distinguishing Neural Speech Synthesis Models Through Fingerprints in Speech Waveforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06780v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent strides in neural speech synthesis technologies, while enjoying widespread applications, have nonetheless introduced a series of challenges, spurring interest in the defence against the threat of misuse and abuse. Notably, source attribution of synthesized speech has value in forensics and intellectual property protection, but prior work in this area has certain limitations in scope. To address the gaps, we present our findings concerning the identification of the sources of synthesized speech in this paper. We investigate the existence of speech synthesis model fingerprints in the generated speech waveforms, with a focus on the acoustic model and the vocoder, and study the influence of each component on the fingerprint in the overall speech waveforms. Our research, conducted using the multi-speaker LibriTTS dataset, demonstrates two key insights: (1) vocoders and acoustic models impart distinct, model-specific fingerprints on the waveforms they generate, and (2) vocoder fingerprints are the more dominant of the two, and may mask the fingerprints from the acoustic model. These findings strongly suggest the existence of model-specific fingerprints for both the acoustic model and the vocoder, highlighting their potential utility in source identification applications.</p></details> | 2024-06-18 | Accepted by CCL 2024 |

However, they require a large-scale data and possess the same limitations as previous autoregressive speech models, including slow inference speed and lack of robustness. This paper proposes HierSpeech++, a fast and strong zero-shot speech synthesizer for text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC). We verified that hierarchical speech synthesis frameworks could significantly improve the robustness and expressiveness of the synthetic speech. Furthermore, we significantly improve the naturalness and speaker similarity of synthetic speech even in zero-shot speech synthesis scenarios. For text-to-speech, we adopt the text-to-vec framework, which generates a self-supervised speech representation and an F0 representation based on text representations and prosody prompts. Then, HierSpeech++ generates speech from the generated vector, F0, and voice prompt. We further introduce a high-efficient speech super-resolution framework from 16 kHz to 48 kHz. The experimental results demonstrated that the hierarchical variational autoencoder could be a strong zero-shot speech synthesizer given that it outperforms LLM-based and diffusion-based models. Moreover, we achieved the first human-level quality zero-shot speech synthesis.

However, human spontaneous face-to-face conversation has both spoken and non-verbal aspects (here, co-speech gestures). Only recently has research begun to explore the benefits of jointly synthesising these two modalities in a single system. The previous state of the art used non-probabilistic methods, which fail to capture the variability of human speech and motion, and risk producing oversmoothing artefacts and sub-optimal synthesis quality. We present the first diffusion-based probabilistic model, called Diff-TTSG, that jointly learns to synthesise speech and gestures together. Our method can be trained on small datasets from scratch. Furthermore, we describe a set of careful uni- and multi-modal subjective tests for evaluating integrated speech and gesture synthesis systems, and use them to validate our proposed approach.

| **[Generative Semantic Communication for Text-to-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03459v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication is a promising technology to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only the semantic information of the source data. However, traditional semantic communication methods primarily focus on data reconstruction tasks, which may not be efficient for emerging generative tasks such as text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. To address this limitation, this paper develops a novel generative semantic communication framework for TTS synthesis, leveraging generative artificial intelligence technologies. Firstly, we utilize a pre-trained large speech model called WavLM and the residual vector quantization method to construct two semantic knowledge bases (KBs) at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. The KB at the transmitter enables effective semantic extraction, while the KB at the receiver facilitates lifelike speech synthesis. Then, we employ a transformer encoder and a diffusion model to achieve efficient semantic coding without introducing significant communication overhead. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves much higher fidelity for the generated speech than four baselines, in both cases with additive white Gaussian noise channel and Rayleigh fading channel.</p></details> | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by IEEE Globecom Workshop</p></details> |
| **[MsEmoTTS: Multi-scale emotion transfer, prediction, and control for emotional speech synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06460v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expressive synthetic speech is essential for many human-computer interaction and audio broadcast scenarios, and thus synthesizing expressive speech has attracted much attention in recent years. Previous methods performed the expressive speech synthesis either with explicit labels or with a fixed-length style embedding extracted from reference audio, both of which can only learn an average style and thus ignores the multi-scale nature of speech prosody. In this paper, we propose MsEmoTTS, a multi-scale emotional speech synthesis framework, to model the emotion from different levels. Specifically, the proposed method is a typical attention-based sequence-to-sequence model and with proposed three modules, including global-level emotion presenting module (GM), utterance-level emotion presenting module (UM), and local-level emotion presenting module (LM), to model the global emotion category, utterance-level emotion variation, and syllable-level emotion strength, respectively. In addition to modeling the emotion from different levels, the proposed method also allows us to synthesize emotional speech in different ways, i.e., transferring the emotion from reference audio, predicting the emotion from input text, and controlling the emotion strength manually. Extensive experiments conducted on a Chinese emotional speech corpus demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the compared reference audio-based and text-based emotional speech synthesis methods on the emotion transfer speech synthesis and text-based emotion prediction speech synthesis respectively. Besides, the experiments also show that the proposed method can control the emotion expressions flexibly. Detailed analysis shows the effectiveness of each module and the good design of the proposed method.</p></details> | 2022-01-19 |  |

Accented TTS synthesis is challenging as L2 is different from L1 in both in terms of phonetic rendering and prosody pattern. Furthermore, there is no easy solution to the control of the accent intensity in an utterance. In this work, we propose a neural TTS architecture, that allows us to control the accent and its intensity during inference. This is achieved through three novel mechanisms, 1) an accent variance adaptor to model the complex accent variance with three prosody controlling factors, namely pitch, energy and duration; 2) an accent intensity modeling strategy to quantify the accent intensity; 3) a consistency constraint module to encourage the TTS system to render the expected accent intensity at a fine level. Experiments show that the proposed system attains superior performance to the baseline models in terms of accent rendering and intensity control. To our best knowledge, this is the first study of accented TTS synthesis with explicit intensity control.</p></details> | 2022-09-23 | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted for possible journal publication</p></details> |

With the advent of voice cloning for reading-style speech synthesis, a new voice cloning paradigm for human-like and spontaneous speech synthesis is required. We, therefore, focus on personalized spontaneous speech synthesis that can clone both the individual's voice timbre and speech disfluency. Specifically, we deal with filled pauses, a major source of speech disfluency, which is known to play an important role in speech generation and communication in psychology and linguistics. To comparatively evaluate personalized filled pause insertion and non-personalized filled pause prediction methods, we developed a speech synthesis method with a non-personalized external filled pause predictor trained with a multi-speaker corpus. The results clarify the position-word entanglement of filled pauses, i.e., the necessity of precisely predicting positions for naturalness and the necessity of precisely predicting words for individuality on the evaluation of synthesized speech.</p></details> | 2023-09-20 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to APSIPA ASC 2022</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel, unified architecture for jointly synthesising speech acoustics and skeleton-based 3D gesture motion from text, trained using optimal-transport conditional flow matching (OT-CFM). The proposed architecture is simpler than the previous state of the art, has a smaller memory footprint, and can capture the joint distribution of speech and gestures, generating both modalities together in one single process. The new training regime, meanwhile, enables better synthesis quality in much fewer steps (network evaluations) than before. Uni- and multimodal subjective tests demonstrate improved speech naturalness, gesture human-likeness, and cross-modal appropriateness compared to existing benchmarks.

However, this approach suffers from degradation in speech synthesis quality when the reference speech contains noise. In this paper, we propose a noise-robust zero-shot TTS method. We incorporated adapters into the SSL model, which we fine-tuned with the TTS model using noisy reference speech. In addition, to further improve performance, we adopted a speech enhancement (SE) front-end. With these improvements, our proposed SSL-based zero-shot TTS achieved high-quality speech synthesis with noisy reference speech. Through the objective and subjective evaluations, we confirmed that the proposed method is highly robust to noise in reference speech, and effectively works in combination with SE.</p></details> | 2024-01-11 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,3 figures, Accepted to IEEE ICASSP 2024</p></details> |

Prior work has shown that SSL is an effective intermediate representation in two-stage text-to-speech (TTS) for both read and spontaneous speech. However, it is still not clear which SSL and which layer from each SSL model is most suited for spontaneous TTS. We address this shortcoming by extending the scope of comparison for SSL in spontaneous TTS to 6 different SSLs and 3 layers within each SSL. Furthermore, SSL has also shown potential in predicting the mean opinion scores (MOS) of synthesized speech, but this has only been done in read-speech MOS prediction. We extend an SSL-based MOS prediction framework previously developed for scoring read speech synthesis and evaluate its performance on synthesized spontaneous speech. All experiments are conducted twice on two different spontaneous corpora in order to find generalizable trends. Overall, we present comprehensive experimental results on the use of SSL in spontaneous TTS and MOS prediction to further quantify and understand how SSL can be used in spontaneous TTS.

| **[A Waveform Representation Framework for High-quality Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01443v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) generally uses a vocoder to represent speech signals and parameterize them into features for subsequent modeling. Magnitude spectrum has been a dominant feature over the years. Although perceptual studies have shown that phase spectrum is essential to the quality of synthesized speech, it is often ignored by using a minimum phase filter during synthesis and the speech quality suffers. To bypass this bottleneck in vocoded speech, this paper proposes a phase-embedded waveform representation framework and establishes a magnitude-phase joint modeling platform for high-quality SPSS. Our experiments on waveform reconstruction show that the performance is better than that of the widely-used STRAIGHT. Furthermore, the proposed modeling and synthesis platform outperforms a leading-edge, vocoded, deep bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network (DBLSTM-RNN)-based baseline system in various objective evaluation metrics conducted.</p></details> | 2015-10-08 | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and will appear in APSIPA2015; keywords: speech synthesis, LSTM-RNN, vocoder, phase, waveform, modeling</p></details> |
| **[RoVo: Robust Voice Protection Against Unauthorized Speech Synthesis with Embedding-Level Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12686v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of AI-based speech synthesis technologies such as Deep Voice, there is an increasing risk of voice spoofing attacks, including voice phishing and fake news, through unauthorized use of others' voices. Existing defenses that inject adversarial perturbations directly into audio signals have limited effectiveness, as these perturbations can easily be neutralized by speech enhancement methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoVo (Robust Voice), a novel proactive defense technique that injects adversarial perturbations into high-dimensional embedding vectors of audio signals, reconstructing them into protected speech. This approach effectively defends against speech synthesis attacks and also provides strong resistance to speech enhancement models, which represent a secondary attack threat. In extensive experiments, RoVo increased the Defense Success Rate (DSR) by over 70% compared to unprotected speech, across four state-of-the-art speech synthesis models. Specifically, RoVo achieved a DSR of 99.5% on a commercial speaker-verification API, effectively neutralizing speech synthesis attack. Moreover, RoVo's perturbations remained robust even under strong speech enhancement conditions, outperforming traditional methods. A user study confirmed that RoVo preserves both naturalness and usability of protected speech, highlighting its effectiveness in complex and evolving threat scenarios.</p></details> | 2025-05-20 |  |
| **[MaskedSpeech: Context-aware Speech Synthesis with Masking Strategy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06170v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans often speak in a continuous manner which leads to coherent and consistent prosody properties across neighboring utterances. However, most state-of-the-art speech synthesis systems only consider the information within each sentence and ignore the contextual semantic and acoustic features. This makes it inadequate to generate high-quality paragraph-level speech which requires high expressiveness and naturalness. To synthesize natural and expressive speech for a paragraph, a context-aware speech synthesis system named MaskedSpeech is proposed in this paper, which considers both contextual semantic and acoustic features. Inspired by the masking strategy in the speech editing research, the acoustic features of the current sentence are masked out and concatenated with those of contextual speech, and further used as additional model input. The phoneme encoder takes the concatenated phoneme sequence from neighboring sentences as input and learns fine-grained semantic information from contextual text. Furthermore, cross-utterance coarse-grained semantic features are employed to improve the prosody generation. The model is trained to reconstruct the masked acoustic features with the augmentation of both the contextual semantic and acoustic features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MaskedSpeech outperformed the baseline system significantly in terms of naturalness and expressiveness.</p></details> | 2023-05-19 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Interspeech 2023</p></details> |
| **[Parallel Synthesis for Autoregressive Speech Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11806v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive neural vocoders have achieved outstanding performance in speech synthesis tasks such as text-to-speech and voice conversion. An autoregressive vocoder predicts a sample at some time step conditioned on those at previous time steps. Though it synthesizes natural human speech, the iterative generation inevitably makes the synthesis time proportional to the utterance length, leading to low efficiency. Many works were dedicated to generating the whole speech sequence in parallel and proposed GAN-based, flow-based, and score-based vocoders. This paper proposed a new thought for the autoregressive generation. Instead of iteratively predicting samples in a time sequence, the proposed model performs frequency-wise autoregressive generation (FAR) and bit-wise autoregressive generation (BAR) to synthesize speech. In FAR, a speech utterance is split into frequency subbands, and a subband is generated conditioned on the previously generated one. Similarly, in BAR, an 8-bit quantized signal is generated iteratively from the first bit. By redesigning the autoregressive method to compute in domains other than the time domain, the number of iterations in the proposed model is no longer proportional to the utterance length but to the number of subbands/bits, significantly increasing inference efficiency. Besides, a post-filter is employed to sample signals from output posteriors; its training objective is designed based on the characteristics of the proposed methods. Experimental results show that the proposed model can synthesize speech faster than real-time without GPU acceleration. Compared with baseline vocoders, the proposed model achieves better MUSHRA results and shows good generalization ability for unseen speakers and 44 kHz speech.</p></details> | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing</p></details> |

However, progress in dysarthric ASR (DASR) has been limited by high variability in dysarthric speech and limited public availability of dysarthric training data. This paper demonstrates that data augmentation using text-to-dysarthic-speech (TTDS) synthesis for finetuning large ASR models is effective for DASR. Specifically, diffusion-based text-to-speech (TTS) models can produce speech samples similar to dysarthric speech that can be used as additional training data for fine-tuning ASR foundation models, in this case Whisper. Results show improved synthesis metrics and ASR performance for the proposed multi-speaker diffusion-based TTDS data augmentation for ASR fine-tuning compared to current DASR baselines.</p></details> | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Interspeech 2024</p></details> |

However, the inherited iterative sampling process costs hindered their applications to speech synthesis. This paper proposes FastDiff, a fast conditional diffusion model for high-quality speech synthesis. FastDiff employs a stack of time-aware location-variable convolutions of diverse receptive field patterns to efficiently model long-term time dependencies with adaptive conditions. A noise schedule predictor is also adopted to reduce the sampling steps without sacrificing the generation quality. Based on FastDiff, we design an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesizer, FastDiff-TTS, which generates high-fidelity speech waveforms without any intermediate feature (e.g., Mel-spectrogram). Our evaluation of FastDiff demonstrates the state-of-the-art results with higher-quality (MOS 4.28) speech samples. Also, FastDiff enables a sampling speed of 58x faster than real-time on a V100 GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to speech synthesis deployment for the first time. We further show that FastDiff generalized well to the mel-spectrogram inversion of unseen speakers, and FastDiff-TTS outperformed other competing methods in end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis.

It is based on a novel diffusion architecture, that we call U-Audio Transformer (U-AT), that efficiently scales to long sequences and operates in the latent space of a pre-trained audio autoencoder. Conditioned on character-aware language model representations, SESD achieves impressive results despite training on less than 1k hours of speech - far less than current state-of-the-art systems. In fact, it synthesizes more intelligible speech than the state-of-the-art auto-regressive model, VALL-E, while using less than 2% the training data.</p></details> | 2024-09-06 | Interspeech 2024 |

These methods overlook the contextual coherence of paragraphs, leading to reduced naturalness and inconsistencies in style and timbre across the long-form speech. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware Memory (CAM)-based long-context Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. The CAM block integrates and retrieves both long-term memory and local context details, enabling dynamic memory updates and transfers within long paragraphs to guide sentence-level speech synthesis. Furthermore, the prefix mask enhances the in-context learning ability by enabling bidirectional attention on prefix tokens while maintaining unidirectional generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art long-context methods in terms of prosody expressiveness, coherence and context inference cost across paragraph-level speech.</p></details> | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech25</p></details> |

The diversity of human speech, however, often goes beyond the coverage of these corpora. We believe the ability to handle such diversity is crucial for AI systems to achieve human-level communication. Our work explores the use of more abundant real-world data for building speech synthesizers. We train TTS systems using real-world speech from YouTube and podcasts. We observe the mismatch between training and inference alignments in mel-spectrogram based autoregressive models, leading to unintelligible synthesis, and demonstrate that learned discrete codes within multiple code groups effectively resolves this issue. We introduce our MQTTS system whose architecture is designed for multiple code generation and monotonic alignment, along with the use of a clean silence prompt to improve synthesis quality. We conduct ablation analyses to identify the efficacy of our methods. We show that MQTTS outperforms existing TTS systems in several objective and subjective measures.</p></details> | 2023-02-09 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Recently proposed non-AR models, such as FastSpeech 2, have successfully achieved fast speech synthesis system. However, their quality is not satisfactory, especially when the amount of training data is insufficient. To address this problem, we propose an effective data augmentation method using a well-designed AR TTS system. In this method, large-scale synthetic corpora including text-waveform pairs with phoneme duration are generated by the AR TTS system and then used to train the target non-AR model. Perceptual listening test results showed that the proposed method significantly improved the quality of the non-AR TTS system. In particular, we augmented five hours of a training database to 179 hours of a synthetic one. Using these databases, our TTS system consisting of a FastSpeech 2 acoustic model with a Parallel WaveGAN vocoder achieved a mean opinion score of 3.74, which is 40% higher than that achieved by the conventional method.</p></details> | 2020-10-27 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2021</p></details> |
| **[EE-TTS: Emphatic Expressive TTS with Linguistic Information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12107v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Current TTS systems perform well in synthesizing high-quality speech, producing highly expressive speech remains a challenge. Emphasis, as a critical factor in determining the expressiveness of speech, has attracted more attention nowadays. Previous works usually enhance the emphasis by adding intermediate features, but they can not guarantee the overall expressiveness of the speech. To resolve this matter, we propose Emphatic Expressive TTS (EE-TTS), which leverages multi-level linguistic information from syntax and semantics. EE-TTS contains an emphasis predictor that can identify appropriate emphasis positions from text and a conditioned acoustic model to synthesize expressive speech with emphasis and linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that EE-TTS outperforms baseline with MOS improvements of 0.49 and 0.67 in expressiveness and naturalness. EE-TTS also shows strong generalization across different datasets according to AB test results.</p></details> | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2023, fix some typos</p></details> |

In the E2 TTS framework, the text input is converted into a character sequence with filler tokens. The flow-matching-based mel spectrogram generator is then trained based on the audio infilling task. Unlike many previous works, it does not require additional components (e.g., duration model, grapheme-to-phoneme) or complex techniques (e.g., monotonic alignment search). Despite its simplicity, E2 TTS achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS capabilities that are comparable to or surpass previous works, including Voicebox and NaturalSpeech 3. The simplicity of E2 TTS also allows for flexibility in the input representation. We propose several variants of E2 TTS to improve usability during inference.

However, in real-world applications, the diverse range of user-generated descriptions inevitably introduces numerous out-of-domain inputs that challenge the text understanding capabilities of these systems. To address this issue, we propose MoE-TTS, a description-based TTS model designed to enhance the understanding of out-of-domain text descriptions. MoE-TTS employs a modality-based mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach to augment a pre-trained textual large language model (LLM) with a set of specialized weights adapted to the speech modality while maintaining the original LLM frozen during training. This approach allows MoE-TTS to effectively leverage the pre-trained knowledge and text understanding abilities of textual LLMs. Our experimental results indicate that: first, even the most advanced closed-source commercial products can be challenged by carefully designed out-of-domain description test sets; second, MoE-TTS achieves superior performance in generating speech that more accurately reflects the descriptions.

| **[One TTS Alignment To Rule Them All](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10447v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural textto-speech (TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive endto-end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources. In this paper we leverage the alignment mechanism proposed in RAD-TTS as a generic alignment learning framework, easily applicable to a variety of neural TTS models. The framework combines forward-sum algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, and a simple and efficient static prior. In our experiments, the alignment learning framework improves all tested TTS architectures, both autoregressive (Flowtron, Tacotron 2) and non-autoregressive (FastPitch, FastSpeech 2, RAD-TTS). Specifically, it improves alignment convergence speed of existing attention-based mechanisms, simplifies the training pipeline, and makes the models more robust to errors on long utterances. Most importantly, the framework improves the perceived speech synthesis quality, as judged by human evaluators.</p></details> | 2021-08-25 |  |

In order to learn the mel-spectrogram distribution conditioned on the text, we present a likelihood-based optimization method for TTS. Furthermore, to boost up the inference speed, we leverage the accelerated sampling method that allows Diff-TTS to generate raw waveforms much faster without significantly degrading perceptual quality. Through experiments, we verified that Diff-TTS generates 28 times faster than the real-time with a single NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU.</p></details> | 2021-04-06 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to INTERSPEECH 2021</p></details> |

Building on this, Hell et al.[19] introduced the concept of negative interval. Then they proceeded to define signedinterval digraphs/ bigraphs, demonstrating their equivalence to several seemingly distinct classes of digraphs/ bigraphs. They also showed that co-TT graphs are equivalent to symmetric signed-interval digraphs, where some vertices of the digraphs have loops and others do not. We have showed that this actually solve the representation characterization problem of co-TT graphs posed by Monma, Reed and Trotter [24]. In this paper, we characterize signed-interval bigraphs and signed-interval graphs in terms of their biadjacency matrices and adjacency matrices, respectively. Moreover we emphasize on the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, i.e. co-TT graphs. Finally, by utilizing the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, we resolve the open problem of characterizing co-TT graphs in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs, a problem initially posed by Monma, Reed, and Trotter in the same paper.</p></details> | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2206.05917</p></details> |

We develop a novel multimodal framework capable of handling the speech and text modalities as input either individually or together. The proposed model can also be trained with unpaired speech or text data owing to its multimodal nature. We further propose an iterative refinement strategy to improve the STT and TTS performance of our model such that the partial hypothesis at the output can be fed back to the input of our model, thus iteratively improving both STT and TTS predictions. We show that our joint model can effectively perform both STT and TTS tasks, outperforming the STT-specific baseline in all tasks and performing competitively with the TTS-specific baseline across a wide range of evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Arabic Text-To-Speech (TTS) Data Preparation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03255v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People may be puzzled by the fact that voice over recordings data sets exist in addition to Text-to-Speech (TTS), Synthesis system advancements, albeit this is not the case. The goal of this study is to explain the relevance of TTS as well as the data preparation procedures. TTS relies heavily on recorded data since it can have a substantial influence on the outcomes of TTS modules. Furthermore, whether the domain is specialized or general, appropriate data should be developed to address all predicted language variants and domains. Different recording methodologies, taking into account quality and behavior, may also be advantageous in the development of the module. In light of the lack of Arabic language in present synthesizing systems, numerous variables that impact the flow of recorded utterances are being considered in order to manipulate an Arabic TTS module. In this study, two viewpoints will be discussed: linguistics and the creation of high-quality recordings for TTS. The purpose of this work is to offer light on how ground-truth utterances may influence the evolution of speech systems in terms of naturalness, intelligibility, and understanding. Well provide voice actor specs as well as data specs that will assist both voice actors and voice coaches in the studio as well as the annotators who will be evaluating the audios.</p></details> | 2022-04-08 |  |
| **[Compact Neural TTS Voices for Accessibility](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17332v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary text-to-speech solutions for accessibility applications can typically be classified into two categories: (i) device-based statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) or unit selection (USEL) and (ii) cloud-based neural TTS. SPSS and USEL offer low latency and low disk footprint at the expense of naturalness and audio quality. Cloud-based neural TTS systems provide significantly better audio quality and naturalness but regress in terms of latency and responsiveness, rendering these impractical for real-world applications. More recently, neural TTS models were made deployable to run on handheld devices. Nevertheless, latency remains higher than SPSS and USEL, while disk footprint prohibits pre-installation for multiple voices at once. In this work, we describe a high-quality compact neural TTS system achieving latency on the order of 15 ms with low disk footprint. The proposed solution is capable of running on low-power devices.</p></details> | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Investigating context features hidden in End-to-End TTS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01376v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have introduced end-to-end TTS, which integrates the production of context and acoustic features in statistical parametric speech synthesis. As a result, a single neural network replaced laborious feature engineering with automated feature learning. However, little is known about what types of context information end-to-end TTS extracts from text input before synthesizing speech, and the previous knowledge about context features is barely utilized. In this work, we first point out the model similarity between end-to-end TTS and parametric TTS. Based on the similarity, we evaluate the quality of encoder outputs from an end-to-end TTS system against eight criteria that are derived from a standard set of context information used in parametric TTS. We conduct experiments using an evaluation procedure that has been newly developed in the machine learning literature for quantitative analysis of neural representations, while adapting it to the TTS domain. Experimental results show that the encoder outputs reflect both linguistic and phonetic contexts, such as vowel reduction at phoneme level, lexical stress at syllable level, and part-of-speech at word level, possibly due to the joint optimization of context and acoustic features.</p></details> | 2019-02-26 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2019</p></details> |

Attention-based methods achieve great naturalness but suffer from unstable issues like missing and repeating phonemes, not to mention accurate duration control. Duration-informed methods, on the contrary, seem to easily adjust phoneme duration but show obvious degradation in speech naturalness. This paper proposes PAMA-TTS to address the problem. It takes the advantage of both flexible attention and explicit duration models. Based on the monotonic attention mechanism, PAMA-TTS also leverages token duration and relative position of a frame, especially countdown information, i.e. in how many future frames the present phoneme will end. They help the attention to move forward along the token sequence in a soft but reliable control. Experimental results prove that PAMA-TTS achieves the highest naturalness, while has on-par or even better duration controllability than the duration-informed model.</p></details> | 2022-03-21 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2022. 5 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.

In this paper, we propose a new input representation and simple architecture to achieve improved prosody modeling. Inspired by the recent success in the use of discrete code in TTS, we introduce discrete code to the input of the reference encoder. Specifically, we leverage the vector quantizer from the audio compression model to exploit the diverse acoustic information it has already been trained on. In addition, we apply the modified MLP-Mixer to the reference encoder, making the architecture lighter. As a result, we train the prosody transfer TTS in an end-to-end manner. We prove the effectiveness of our method through both subjective and objective evaluations. We demonstrate that the reference encoder learns better speaker-independent prosody when discrete code is utilized as input in the experiments. In addition, we obtain comparable results even when fewer parameters are inputted.</p></details> | 2023-06-29 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Interspeech 2023</p></details> |
| **[Speech BERT Embedding For Improving Prosody in Neural TTS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04312v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a speech BERT model to extract embedded prosody information in speech segments for improving the prosody of synthesized speech in neural text-to-speech (TTS). As a pre-trained model, it can learn prosody attributes from a large amount of speech data, which can utilize more data than the original training data used by the target TTS. The embedding is extracted from the previous segment of a fixed length in the proposed BERT. The extracted embedding is then used together with the mel-spectrogram to predict the following segment in the TTS decoder. Experimental results obtained by the Transformer TTS show that the proposed BERT can extract fine-grained, segment-level prosody, which is complementary to utterance-level prosody to improve the final prosody of the TTS speech. The objective distortions measured on a single speaker TTS are reduced between the generated speech and original recordings. Subjective listening tests also show that the proposed approach is favorably preferred over the TTS without the BERT prosody embedding module, for both in-domain and out-of-domain applications. For Microsoft professional, single/multiple speakers and the LJ Speaker in the public database, subjective preference is similarly confirmed with the new BERT prosody embedding.

Guided-TTS combines an unconditional diffusion probabilistic model with a separately trained phoneme classifier for classifier guidance. Our unconditional diffusion model learns to generate speech without any context from untranscribed speech data. For TTS synthesis, we guide the generative process of the diffusion model with a phoneme classifier trained on a large-scale speech recognition dataset. We present a norm-based scaling method that reduces the pronunciation errors of classifier guidance in Guided-TTS. We show that Guided-TTS achieves a performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art TTS model, Grad-TTS, without any transcript for LJSpeech. We further demonstrate that Guided-TTS performs well on diverse datasets including a long-form untranscribed dataset.</p></details> | 2022-06-13 | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, ICML'2022</p></details> |

To shorten the sequence length of speech tokens, acoustic byte-pair encoding (BPE) has emerged in SLM that treats speech tokens from self-supervised semantic representations as characters to further compress the token sequence. But the gain in TTS has not been fully investigated, and the proper choice of acoustic BPE remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on various settings of acoustic BPE to explore its effectiveness in decoder-only TTS models with semantic speech tokens. Experiments on LibriTTS verify that acoustic BPE uniformly increases the intelligibility and diversity of synthesized speech, while showing different features across BPE settings. Hence, acoustic BPE is a favorable tool for decoder-only TTS.</p></details> | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 tables, 1 figures. accepted to Interspeech 2024</p></details> |
| **[Prosody-controllable spontaneous TTS with neural HMMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13533v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spontaneous speech has many affective and pragmatic functions that are interesting and challenging to model in TTS. However, the presence of reduced articulation, fillers, repetitions, and other disfluencies in spontaneous speech make the text and acoustics less aligned than in read speech, which is problematic for attention-based TTS. We propose a TTS architecture that can rapidly learn to speak from small and irregular datasets, while also reproducing the diversity of expressive phenomena present in spontaneous speech. Specifically, we add utterance-level prosody control to an existing neural HMM-based TTS system which is capable of stable, monotonic alignments for spontaneous speech. We objectively evaluate control accuracy and perform perceptual tests that demonstrate that prosody control does not degrade synthesis quality. To exemplify the power of combining prosody control and ecologically valid data for reproducing intricate spontaneous speech phenomena, we evaluate the system's capability of synthesizing two types of creaky voice.

However, generating human-parity long-form speech with high dynamic prosodic variations is still challenging. To address this problem, we expand the capabilities of GNNs with a hierarchical prosody modeling approach, named HiGNN-TTS. Specifically, we add a virtual global node in the graph to strengthen the interconnection of word nodes and introduce a contextual attention mechanism to broaden the prosody modeling scope of GNNs from intra-sentence to inter-sentence. Additionally, we perform hierarchical supervision from acoustic prosody on each node of the graph to capture the prosodic variations with a high dynamic range. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of HiGNN-TTS in learning hierarchical prosody. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that HiGNN-TTS significantly improves the naturalness and expressiveness of long-form synthetic speech.</p></details> | 2023-10-10 | Accepted by ASRU2023 |

It is however unclear which speech SSL is the better fit for TTS, and whether or not the performance differs between read and spontaneous TTS, the later of which is arguably more challenging. This study aims at addressing these questions by testing several speech SSLs, including different layers of the same SSL, in two-stage TTS on both read and spontaneous corpora, while maintaining constant TTS model architecture and training settings. Results from listening tests show that the 9th layer of 12-layer wav2vec2.0 (ASR finetuned) outperforms other tested SSLs and mel-spectrogram, in both read and spontaneous TTS. Our work sheds light on both how speech SSL can readily improve current TTS systems, and how SSLs compare in the challenging generative task of TTS.

Through a user study, we show that our approach significantly outperforms naïve vocoding strategies while being hundreds of times faster than neural network vocoders used in state-of-the-art TTS systems. We also show that our method can be used to achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised synthesis of individual words of speech.</p></details> | 2019-07-29 | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at INTERSPEECH 2019</p></details> |

To address these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable, open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.</p></details> | 2025-09-30 | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Given the fast growth in DLRMs, novel solutions are urgently needed, in order to enable fast and efficient DLRM innovations. At the same time, this must be done without having to exponentially increase infrastructure capacity demands. In this paper, we demonstrate the promising potential of Tensor Train decomposition for DLRMs (TT-Rec), an important yet under-investigated context. We design and implement optimized kernels (TT-EmbeddingBag) to evaluate the proposed TT-Rec design. TT-EmbeddingBag is 3 times faster than the SOTA TT implementation. The performance of TT-Rec is further optimized with the batched matrix multiplication and caching strategies for embedding vector lookup operations. In addition, we present mathematically and empirically the effect of weight initialization distribution on DLRM accuracy and propose to initialize the tensor cores of TT-Rec following the sampled Gaussian distribution. We evaluate TT-Rec across three important design space dimensions -- memory capacity, accuracy, and timing performance -- by training MLPerf-DLRM with Criteo's Kaggle and Terabyte data sets. TT-Rec achieves 117 times and 112 times model size compression, for Kaggle and Terabyte, respectively. This impressive model size reduction can come with no accuracy nor training time overhead as compared to the uncompressed baseline.</p></details> | 2021-01-29 | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Conference on Machine Learning and Systems (MlSys 2021, https://mlsys.org/)</p></details> |

However, it's still a challenge to build a high-quality conversational TTS due to the limitations of the corpus and modeling capability. This study aims at building a conversational TTS for a voice agent under sequence to sequence modeling framework. We firstly construct a spontaneous conversational speech corpus well designed for the voice agent with a new recording scheme ensuring both recording quality and conversational speaking style. Secondly, we propose a conversation context-aware end-to-end TTS approach which has an auxiliary encoder and a conversational context encoder to reinforce the information about the current utterance and its context in a conversation as well. Experimental results show that the proposed methods produce more natural prosody in accordance with the conversational context, with significant preference gains at both utterance-level and conversation-level. Moreover, we find that the model has the ability to express some spontaneous behaviors, like fillers and repeated words, which makes the conversational speaking style more realistic.</p></details> | 2020-11-17 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SLT 2021; 7 pages</p></details> |

Here we propose an enhanced ASR-TTS (EAT) model that incorporates two main features: 1) The ASR$\rightarrow$TTS direction is equipped with a language model reward to penalize the ASR hypotheses before forwarding it to TTS. 2) In the TTS$\rightarrow$ASR direction, a hyper-parameter is introduced to scale the attention context from synthesized speech before sending it to ASR to handle out-of-domain data. Training strategies and the effectiveness of the EAT model are explored under out-of-domain data conditions.

| **[When Is TTS Augmentation Through a Pivot Language Useful?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09889v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages is a challenge due to the small amount of transcribed audio data. For many such languages, audio and text are available separately, but not audio with transcriptions. Using text, speech can be synthetically produced via text-to-speech (TTS) systems. However, many low-resource languages do not have quality TTS systems either. We propose an alternative: produce synthetic audio by running text from the target language through a trained TTS system for a higher-resource pivot language. We investigate when and how this technique is most effective in low-resource settings. In our experiments, using several thousand synthetic TTS text-speech pairs and duplicating authentic data to balance yields optimal results. Our findings suggest that searching over a set of candidate pivot languages can lead to marginal improvements and that, surprisingly, ASR performance can by harmed by increases in measured TTS quality. Application of these findings improves ASR by 64.5\% and 45.0\% character error reduction rate (CERR) respectively for two low-resource languages: Guaraní and Suba.</p></details> | 2022-07-21 |  |
| **[Intelli-Z: Toward Intelligible Zero-Shot TTS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13921v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although numerous recent studies have suggested new frameworks for zero-shot TTS using large-scale, real-world data, studies that focus on the intelligibility of zero-shot TTS are relatively scarce. Zero-shot TTS demands additional efforts to ensure clear pronunciation and speech quality due to its inherent requirement of replacing a core parameter (speaker embedding or acoustic prompt) with a new one at the inference stage. In this study, we propose a zero-shot TTS model focused on intelligibility, which we refer to as Intelli-Z. Intelli-Z learns speaker embeddings by using multi-speaker TTS as its teacher and is trained with a cycle-consistency loss to include mismatched text-speech pairs for training. Additionally, it selectively aggregates speaker embeddings along the temporal dimension to minimize the interference of the text content of reference speech at the inference stage. We substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed methods with an ablation study. The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) increases by 9% for unseen speakers when the first two methods are applied, and it further improves by 16% when selective temporal aggregation is applied.</p></details> | 2024-01-31 |  |

E3 TTS directly takes plain text as input and generates an audio waveform through an iterative refinement process.

Instead, E3 TTS models the temporal structure of the waveform through the diffusion process. Without relying on additional conditioning information, E3 TTS could support flexible latent structure within the given audio. This enables E3 TTS to be easily adapted for zero-shot tasks such as editing without any additional training. Experiments show that E3 TTS can generate high-fidelity audio, approaching the performance of a state-of-the-art neural TTS system.

Selecting the model using a training-objective metric such as the least mean squared error does not always correlate with human perception. In this paper, we propose an objective metric based on the phone error rate (PER) to select the TTS model with the best speech intelligibility. The PER is computed between the input text to the TTS model, and the text decoded from the synthesized speech using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, which is trained on the same data as the TTS model. With the help of subjective studies, we show that the TTS model chosen with the least PER on validation split has significantly higher speech intelligibility compared to the model with the least training-objective metric loss. Finally, using the proposed PER and subjective evaluation, we show that the choice of best TTS model depends on the genre of the target domain text. All our experiments are conducted on a Hindi language dataset. However, the proposed model selection method is language independent.</p></details> | 2020-06-03 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to INTERSPEECH 2020</p></details> |

Keyword spotting models require a huge amount of training data to be accurate, and obtaining such training data can be costly. In the current state of the art, TTS models can generate large amounts of natural-sounding data, which can help reducing cost and time for KWS model development. Still, TTS generated data can be lacking diversity compared to real data. To pursue maximizing KWS model accuracy under the constraint of limited resources and current TTS capability, we explored various strategies to mix TTS data and real human speech data, with a focus on minimizing real data use and maximizing diversity of TTS output. Our experimental results indicate that relatively small amounts of real audio data with speaker diversity (100 speakers, 2k utterances) and large amounts of TTS synthesized data can achieve reasonably high accuracy (within 3x error rate of baseline), compared to the baseline (trained with 3.8M real positive utterances).</p></details> | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in a Workshop at Interspeech 2024, Synthetic Data's Transformative Role in Foundational Speech Models</p></details> |

However, the perceived quality of audio depends not solely on its content, pitch, rhythm, and energy, but also on the physical environment. In this work, we propose ViT-TTS, the first visual TTS model with scalable diffusion transformers. ViT-TTS complement the phoneme sequence with the visual information to generate high-perceived audio, opening up new avenues for practical applications of AR and VR to allow a more immersive and realistic audio experience. To mitigate the data scarcity in learning visual acoustic information, we 1) introduce a self-supervised learning framework to enhance both the visual-text encoder and denoiser decoder; 2) leverage the diffusion transformer scalable in terms of parameters and capacity to learn visual scene information. Experimental results demonstrate that ViT-TTS achieves new state-of-the-art results, outperforming cascaded systems and other baselines regardless of the visibility of the scene. With low-resource data (1h, 2h, 5h), ViT-TTS achieves comparative results with rich-resource baselines.~\footnote{Audio samples are available at \url{https://ViT-TTS.github.io/.}}</p></details> | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2023</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised TTS Acoustic Modeling for TTS with Conditional Disentangled Sequential VAE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02512v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised text-to-speech acoustic model training scheme, named UTTS, which does not require text-audio pairs. UTTS is a multi-speaker speech synthesizer that supports zero-shot voice cloning, it is developed from a perspective of disentangled speech representation learning. The framework offers a flexible choice of a speaker's duration model, timbre feature (identity) and content for TTS inference. We leverage recent advancements in self-supervised speech representation learning as well as speech synthesis front-end techniques for system development. Specifically, we employ our recently formulated Conditional Disentangled Sequential Variational Auto-encoder (C-DSVAE) as the backbone UTTS AM, which offers well-structured content representations given unsupervised alignment (UA) as condition during training. For UTTS inference, we utilize a lexicon to map input text to the phoneme sequence, which is expanded to the frame-level forced alignment (FA) with a speaker-dependent duration model. Then, we develop an alignment mapping module that converts FA to UA. Finally, the C-DSVAE, serving as the self-supervised TTS AM, takes the predicted UA and a target speaker embedding to generate the mel spectrogram, which is ultimately converted to waveform with a neural vocoder.

| **[EME-TTS: Unlocking the Emphasis and Emotion Link in Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12015v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, emotional Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis and emphasis-controllable speech synthesis have advanced significantly. However, their interaction remains underexplored. We propose Emphasis Meets Emotion TTS (EME-TTS), a novel framework designed to address two key research questions: (1) how to effectively utilize emphasis to enhance the expressiveness of emotional speech, and (2) how to maintain the perceptual clarity and stability of target emphasis across different emotions. EME-TTS employs weakly supervised learning with emphasis pseudo-labels and variance-based emphasis features. Additionally, the proposed Emphasis Perception Enhancement (EPE) block enhances the interaction between emotional signals and emphasis positions. Experimental results show that EME-TTS, when combined with large language models for emphasis position prediction, enables more natural emotional speech synthesis while preserving stable and distinguishable target emphasis across emotions. Synthesized samples are available on-line.</p></details> | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

However Deep Learning-based algorithms require amounts of data that are often difficult and costly to gather. Particularly, modeling the variability in speech of different speakers, different styles or different emotions with few data remains challenging. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage fine-tuning on a pre-trained Deep Learning-based TTS model to synthesize speech with a small dataset of another speaker. Then we investigate the possibility to adapt this model to have emotional TTS by fine-tuning the neutral TTS model with a small emotional dataset.</p></details> | 2019-01-15 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IntelliSys 2019</p></details> |

Correspondingly, we investigate the use of a multi-speaker TTS system to synthesize speech in support of speaker recognition. In this study we focus the analysis on tasks where a relatively small number of speakers is available for training. We observe on our datasets that TTS synthesized speech improves cross-domain speaker recognition performance and can be combined effectively with multi-style training. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of different types of text transcripts used for TTS synthesis. Results suggest that matching the textual content of the target domain is a good practice, and if that is not feasible, a transcript with a sufficiently large vocabulary is recommended.</p></details> | 2020-11-25 |  |

However, previous approaches require substantial annotated training data and additional efforts from language experts, making it difficult to extend high-quality neural TTS systems to out-of-domain daily conversations and countless languages worldwide. This paper tackles the polyphone disambiguation problem from a concise and novel perspective: we propose Dict-TTS, a semantic-aware generative text-to-speech model with an online website dictionary (the existing prior information in the natural language). Specifically, we design a semantics-to-pronunciation attention (S2PA) module to match the semantic patterns between the input text sequence and the prior semantics in the dictionary and obtain the corresponding pronunciations; The S2PA module can be easily trained with the end-to-end TTS model without any annotated phoneme labels. Experimental results in three languages show that our model outperforms several strong baseline models in terms of pronunciation accuracy and improves the prosody modeling of TTS systems. Further extensive analyses demonstrate that each design in Dict-TTS is effective. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Zain-Jiang/Dict-TTS}.</p></details> | 2023-10-20 | <details><summary>v3: f...</summary><p>v3: fix the introduction for the concurrent similar work of Neural Lexicon Reader (arXiv:2110.09698)</p></details> |

While reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced LLM performance in text-based tasks, its application to ASR and TTS remains underexplored due to the complexity of training audio-based models. In this study, we propose a lightweight RL framework tailored for audio-based LLMs that can process audio inputs and generate audio outputs. Based on this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve improved performance. Our experiments demonstrate that RL can significantly enhance the performance of both ASR and TTS systems, even with limited training data and a small number of optimization steps.</p></details> | 2025-09-24 |  |
| **[Adapting TTS models For New Speakers using Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05798v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training neural text-to-speech (TTS) models for a new speaker typically requires several hours of high quality speech data. Prior works on voice cloning attempt to address this challenge by adapting pre-trained multi-speaker TTS models for a new voice, using a few minutes of speech data of the new speaker. However, publicly available large multi-speaker datasets are often noisy, thereby resulting in TTS models that are not suitable for use in products. We address this challenge by proposing transfer-learning guidelines for adapting high quality single-speaker TTS models for a new speaker, using only a few minutes of speech data. We conduct an extensive study using different amounts of data for a new speaker and evaluate the synthesized speech in terms of naturalness and voice/style similarity to the target speaker. We find that fine-tuning a single-speaker TTS model on just 30 minutes of data, can yield comparable performance to a model trained from scratch on more than 27 hours of data for both male and female target speakers.</p></details> | 2022-04-07 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Interspeech 2022</p></details> |

Seed-TTS serves as a foundation model for speech generation and excels in speech in-context learning, achieving performance in speaker similarity and naturalness that matches ground truth human speech in both objective and subjective evaluations. With fine-tuning, we achieve even higher subjective scores across these metrics. Seed-TTS offers superior controllability over various speech attributes such as emotion and is capable of generating highly expressive and diverse speech for speakers in the wild. Furthermore, we propose a self-distillation method for speech factorization, as well as a reinforcement learning approach to enhance model robustness, speaker similarity, and controllability. We additionally present a non-autoregressive (NAR) variant of the Seed-TTS model, named $\text{Seed-TTS}_\text{DiT}$, which utilizes a fully diffusion-based architecture. Unlike previous NAR-based TTS systems, $\text{Seed-TTS}_\text{DiT}$ does not depend on pre-estimated phoneme durations and performs speech generation through end-to-end processing. We demonstrate that this variant achieves comparable performance to the language model-based variant and showcase its effectiveness in speech editing.

| **[A Language Modeling Approach to Diacritic-Free Hebrew TTS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12206v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the task of text-to-speech (TTS) in Hebrew. Traditional Hebrew contains Diacritics, which dictate the way individuals should pronounce given words, however, modern Hebrew rarely uses them. The lack of diacritics in modern Hebrew results in readers expected to conclude the correct pronunciation and understand which phonemes to use based on the context. This imposes a fundamental challenge on TTS systems to accurately map between text-to-speech. In this work, we propose to adopt a language modeling Diacritics-Free approach, for the task of Hebrew TTS. The model operates on discrete speech representations and is conditioned on a word-piece tokenizer. We optimize the proposed method using in-the-wild weakly supervised data and compare it to several diacritic-based TTS systems. Results suggest the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines considering both content preservation and naturalness of the generated speech.

Despite the advantage, the parallel TTS models cannot be trained without guidance from autoregressive TTS models as their external aligners. In this work, we propose Glow-TTS, a flow-based generative model for parallel TTS that does not require any external aligner. By combining the properties of flows and dynamic programming, the proposed model searches for the most probable monotonic alignment between text and the latent representation of speech on its own. We demonstrate that enforcing hard monotonic alignments enables robust TTS, which generalizes to long utterances, and employing generative flows enables fast, diverse, and controllable speech synthesis. Glow-TTS obtains an order-of-magnitude speed-up over the autoregressive model, Tacotron 2, at synthesis with comparable speech quality. We further show that our model can be easily extended to a multi-speaker setting.</p></details> | 2020-10-26 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2020</p></details> |
| **[Stochastic Pitch Prediction Improves the Diversity and Naturalness of Speech in Glow-TTS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17724v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-based generative models are widely used in text-to-speech (TTS) systems to learn the distribution of audio features (e.g., Mel-spectrograms) given the input tokens and to sample from this distribution to generate diverse utterances. However, in the zero-shot multi-speaker TTS scenario, the generated utterances lack diversity and naturalness. In this paper, we propose to improve the diversity of utterances by explicitly learning the distribution of fundamental frequency sequences (pitch contours) of each speaker during training using a stochastic flow-based pitch predictor, then conditioning the model on generated pitch contours during inference. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields a significant improvement in the naturalness and diversity of speech generated by a Glow-TTS model that uses explicit stochastic pitch prediction, over a Glow-TTS baseline and an improved Glow-TTS model that uses a stochastic duration predictor.</p></details> | 2023-05-30 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures, InterSpeech 2023</p></details> |

Utilizing large amounts of text-to-speech (TTS) synthesized data can reduce the cost and time associated with KWS development. However, TTS data may contain artifacts not present in real speech, which the KWS model can exploit (overfit), leading to degraded accuracy on real speech. To address this issue, we propose applying an adversarial training method to prevent the KWS model from learning TTS-specific features when trained on large amounts of TTS data. Experimental results demonstrate that KWS model accuracy on real speech data can be improved by up to 12% when adversarial loss is used in addition to the original KWS loss. Surprisingly, we also observed that the adversarial setup improves accuracy by up to 8%, even when trained solely on TTS and real negative speech data, without any real positive examples.</p></details> | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in a Workshop at Interspeech 2024, Synthetic Data's Transformative Role in Foundational Speech Models</p></details> |

By the difficulty of obtaining multilingual corpus for given speaker, training multilingual TTS model with monolingual corpora is unavoidable. We introduce speaker regularization loss that improves speech naturalness during cross-lingual synthesis as well as domain adversarial training, which is applied in other multilingual TTS models. Furthermore, by adding speaker regularization loss, replacing speaker embedding with zero vector in duration predictor stabilizes cross-lingual inference. With this replacement, our model generates speeches with moderate rhythm regardless of source speaker in cross-lingual synthesis. In MOS evaluation, SANE-TTS achieves naturalness score above 3.80 both in cross-lingual and intralingual synthesis, where the ground truth score is 3.99. Also, SANE-TTS maintains speaker similarity close to that of ground truth even in cross-lingual inference.

The autoregressive TTS (AR-TTS) models based on the sequence-to-sequence architecture can generate high-quality speech, but their sequential decoding process can be time-consuming. Recently, non-autoregressive TTS (NAR-TTS) models have been shown to be more efficient with the parallel decoding process. However, these NAR-TTS models rely on phoneme-level durations to generate a hard alignment between the text and the spectrogram. Obtaining duration labels, either through forced alignment or knowledge distillation, is cumbersome. Furthermore, hard alignment based on phoneme expansion can degrade the naturalness of the synthesized speech. In contrast, the proposed model of VAENAR-TTS is an end-to-end approach that does not require phoneme-level durations. The VAENAR-TTS model does not contain recurrent structures and is completely non-autoregressive in both the training and inference phases. Based on the VAE architecture, the alignment information is encoded in the latent variable, and attention-based soft alignment between the text and the latent variable is used in the decoder to reconstruct the spectrogram. Experiments show that VAENAR-TTS achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality, while the synthesis speed is comparable with other NAR-TTS models.</p></details> | 2021-07-08 |  |

While numerous attempts have been made to the few-shot speaker adaptation system, there is still a gap in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker depending on the amount of data. To bridge the gap, we propose GC-TTS which achieves high-quality speaker adaptation with significantly improved speaker similarity. Specifically, we leverage two geometric constraints to learn discriminative speaker representations. Here, a TTS model is pre-trained for base speakers with a sufficient amount of data, and then fine-tuned for novel speakers on a few minutes of data with two geometric constraints. Two geometric constraints enable the model to extract discriminative speaker embeddings from limited data, which leads to the synthesis of intelligible speech. We discuss and verify the effectiveness of GC-TTS by comparing it with popular and essential methods. The experimental results demonstrate that GC-TTS generates high-quality speech from only a few minutes of training data, outperforming standard techniques in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker.</p></details> | 2021-08-17 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC 2021)</p></details> |

In contrast to conventional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | 2025-07-09 |  |

By leveraging advanced speech processing techniques, we compare TTS-generated audio with human-recorded speech to analyze differences in pitch, duration, and energy. Key features are extracted using tools like PyWorld and Librosa, which are then adjusted to align with the prosodic characteristics of natural human speech. The modified features undergo synthesis, producing enhanced TTS outputs that more closely mirror the natural prosody of human speech. This approach aims to enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of TTS systems by providing a framework for precise prosodic parameter adjustments. Our methodology involves feature extraction, prosodic manipulation, and synthesis, followed by comprehensive evaluations to ensure consistency with human speech patterns. The findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of prosodic parameter manipulation for controlled speech generation, highlighting its potential to significantly improve TTS applications.</p></details> | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Summer School on NLP 2024 at IIIT Hyderabad</p></details> |

However, existing LLM-based TTS models often lack open-source training code and efficient inference acceleration frameworks, limiting their accessibility and adaptability. Additionally, there is no publicly available TTS model specifically optimized for podcast scenarios, which are in high demand for voice interaction applications. To address these limitations, we introduce Muyan-TTS, an open-source trainable TTS model designed for podcast applications within a $50,000 budget. Our model is pre-trained on over 100,000 hours of podcast audio data, enabling zero-shot TTS synthesis with high-quality voice generation. Furthermore, Muyan-TTS supports speaker adaptation with dozens of minutes of target speech, making it highly customizable for individual voices. In addition to open-sourcing the model, we provide a comprehensive data collection and processing pipeline, a full training procedure, and an optimized inference framework that accelerates LLM-based TTS synthesis.

In this study, we present Diffusion-based EXpressive TTS (DEX-TTS), an acoustic model designed for reference-based speech synthesis with enhanced style representations. Based on a general diffusion TTS framework, DEX-TTS includes encoders and adapters to handle styles extracted from reference speech. Key innovations contain the differentiation of styles into time-invariant and time-variant categories for effective style extraction, as well as the design of encoders and adapters with high generalization ability. In addition, we introduce overlapping patchify and convolution-frequency patch embedding strategies to improve DiT-based diffusion networks for TTS. DEX-TTS yields outstanding performance in terms of objective and subjective evaluation in English multi-speaker and emotional multi-speaker datasets, without relying on pre-training strategies. Lastly, the comparison results for the general TTS on a single-speaker dataset verify the effectiveness of our enhanced diffusion backbone.

We train the speaker-conditional diffusion model on large-scale untranscribed datasets for a classifier-free guidance method and further fine-tune the diffusion model on the reference speech of the target speaker for adaptation, which only takes 40 seconds. We demonstrate that Guided-TTS 2 shows comparable performance to high-quality single-speaker TTS baselines in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity with only a ten-second untranscribed data. We further show that Guided-TTS 2 outperforms adaptive TTS baselines on multi-speaker datasets even with a zero-shot adaptation setting. Guided-TTS 2 can adapt to a wide range of voices only using untranscribed speech, which enables adaptive TTS with the voice of non-human characters such as Gollum in \textit{"The Lord of the Rings"}.</p></details> | 2022-06-01 |  |

We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing subjective tests.</p></details> | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at InterSpeech 2025</p></details> |

| **[Training Audio Captioning Models without Audio](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07372v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) is the task of generating natural language descriptions given an audio stream. A typical AAC system requires manually curated training data of audio segments and corresponding text caption annotations. The creation of these audio-caption pairs is costly, resulting in general data scarcity for the task. In this work, we address this major limitation and propose an approach to train AAC systems using only text. Our approach leverages the multimodal space of contrastively trained audio-text models, such as CLAP. During training, a decoder generates captions conditioned on the pretrained CLAP text encoder. During inference, the text encoder is replaced with the pretrained CLAP audio encoder. To bridge the modality gap between text and audio embeddings, we propose the use of noise injection or a learnable adapter, during training. We find that the proposed text-only framework performs competitively with state-of-the-art models trained with paired audio, showing that efficient text-to-audio transfer is possible. Finally, we showcase both stylized audio captioning and caption enrichment while training without audio or human-created text captions.</p></details> | 2023-09-15 |  |

It is an intermodal translation task (not speech-to-text), where a system accepts as an input an audio signal and outputs the textual description (i.e. the caption) of that signal. In this paper we present Clotho, a dataset for audio captioning consisting of 4981 audio samples of 15 to 30 seconds duration and 24 905 captions of eight to 20 words length, and a baseline method to provide initial results. Clotho is built with focus on audio content and caption diversity, and the splits of the data are not hampering the training or evaluation of methods. All sounds are from the Freesound platform, and captions are crowdsourced using Amazon Mechanical Turk and annotators from English speaking countries. Unique words, named entities, and speech transcription are removed with post-processing. Clotho is freely available online (https://zenodo.org/record/3490684).</p></details> | 2019-10-22 |  |

Pre-trained models are widely used in audio captioning due to high complexity. Unless a comprehensive system is re-trained, it is hard to determine how well pre-trained models contribute to audio captioning system. To prevent the time consuming and energy consuming process of retraining, it is necessary to propose a preditor of performance for the pre-trained model in audio captioning. In this paper, a series of pre-trained models are investigated for the correlation between extracted audio features and the performance of audio captioning. A couple of predictor is proposed based on the experiment results.The result demonstrates that the kurtosis and skewness of audio features extracted may act as an indicator of the performance of audio captioning systems for pre-trained audio due to the high correlation between kurtosis and skewness of audio features and the performance of audio captioning systems.</p></details> | 2022-08-15 | 5 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Audio Difference Learning for Audio Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08141v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a novel training paradigm, audio difference learning, for improving audio captioning. The fundamental concept of the proposed learning method is to create a feature representation space that preserves the relationship between audio, enabling the generation of captions that detail intricate audio information. This method employs a reference audio along with the input audio, both of which are transformed into feature representations via a shared encoder. Captions are then generated from these differential features to describe their differences. Furthermore, a unique technique is proposed that involves mixing the input audio with additional audio, and using the additional audio as a reference. This results in the difference between the mixed audio and the reference audio reverting back to the original input audio. This allows the original input's caption to be used as the caption for their difference, eliminating the need for additional annotations for the differences. In the experiments using the Clotho and ESC50 datasets, the proposed method demonstrated an improvement in the SPIDEr score by 7% compared to conventional methods.</p></details> | 2023-09-18 | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICASSP2024</p></details> |
| **[Caption Feature Space Regularization for Audio Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08409v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio captioning aims at describing the content of audio clips with human language. Due to the ambiguity of audio, different people may perceive the same audio differently, resulting in caption disparities (i.e., one audio may correlate to several captions with diverse semantics). For that, general audio captioning models achieve the one-to-many training by randomly selecting a correlated caption as the ground truth for each audio. However, it leads to a significant variation in the optimization directions and weakens the model stability. To eliminate this negative effect, in this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for audio captioning: (i) in the first stage, via the contrastive learning, we construct a proxy feature space to reduce the distances between captions correlated to the same audio, and (ii) in the second stage, the proxy feature space is utilized as additional supervision to encourage the model to be optimized in the direction that benefits all the correlated captions. We conducted extensive experiments on two datasets using four commonly used encoder and decoder architectures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

| **[Audio Captioning Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09817v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio captioning aims to automatically generate a natural language description of an audio clip. Most captioning models follow an encoder-decoder architecture, where the decoder predicts words based on the audio features extracted by the encoder. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are often used as the audio encoder. However, CNNs can be limited in modelling temporal relationships among the time frames in an audio signal, while RNNs can be limited in modelling the long-range dependencies among the time frames. In this paper, we propose an Audio Captioning Transformer (ACT), which is a full Transformer network based on an encoder-decoder architecture and is totally convolution-free. The proposed method has a better ability to model the global information within an audio signal as well as capture temporal relationships between audio events. We evaluate our model on AudioCaps, which is the largest audio captioning dataset publicly available. Our model shows competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 2021-07-22 | 5 pages, 1 figure |

Additionally, our proposed method can transfer to any domain without the need for any additional fine-tuning. To generate a caption for an audio sample, we leverage an audio-text model CLAP to retrieve captions similar to it from a replaceable datastore, which are then used to construct a prompt. Next, we feed this prompt to a GPT-2 decoder and introduce cross-attention layers between the CLAP encoder and GPT-2 to condition the audio for caption generation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, Clotho and AudioCaps, show that RECAP achieves competitive performance in in-domain settings and significant improvements in out-of-domain settings. Additionally, due to its capability to exploit a large text-captions-only datastore in a training-free fashion, RECAP shows unique capabilities of captioning novel audio events never seen during training and compositional audios with multiple events. To promote research in this space, we also release 150,000+ new weakly labeled captions for AudioSet, AudioCaps, and Clotho.</p></details> | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2024.

To evaluate machine-generated captions, the metrics should take into account audio events, acoustic scenes, paralinguistics, signal characteristics, and other audio information. Traditional AAC evaluation relies on natural language generation metrics like ROUGE and BLEU, image captioning metrics such as SPICE and CIDEr, or Sentence-BERT embedding similarity. However, these metrics only compare generated captions to human references, overlooking the audio signal itself. In this work, we propose MACE (Multimodal Audio-Caption Evaluation), a novel metric that integrates both audio and reference captions for comprehensive audio caption evaluation. MACE incorporates audio information from audio as well as predicted and reference captions and weights it with a fluency penalty. Our experiments demonstrate MACE's superior performance in predicting human quality judgments compared to traditional metrics. Specifically, MACE achieves a 3.28% and 4.36% relative accuracy improvement over the FENSE metric on the AudioCaps-Eval and Clotho-Eval datasets respectively. Moreover, it significantly outperforms all the previous metrics on the audio captioning evaluation task.

Different from speech recognition which translates audio content that contains spoken language into text, audio captioning is commonly concerned with ambient sounds, or sounds produced by a human performing an action. Inspired by zero-shot image captioning methods, we propose ZerAuCap, a novel framework for summarising such general audio signals in a text caption without requiring task-specific training. In particular, our framework exploits a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for generating the text which is guided by a pre-trained audio-language model to produce captions that describe the audio content. Additionally, we use audio context keywords that prompt the language model to generate text that is broadly relevant to sounds. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot audio captioning on the AudioCaps and Clotho datasets.

Although prior methods have leveraged \textit{text-only language models} to augment and improve captions, such methods have limitations related to scale and coherence between audio and captions. In this work, we propose an audio captioning pipeline that uses an \textit{audio language model} to synthesize accurate and diverse captions for audio at scale. We leverage this pipeline to produce a dataset of synthetic captions for AudioSet, named \texttt{AF-AudioSet}, and then evaluate the benefit of pre-training text-to-audio models on these synthetic captions. Through systematic evaluations on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, we find leveraging our pipeline and synthetic captions leads to significant improvements on audio generation quality, achieving a new \textit{state-of-the-art}.</p></details> | 2024-07-10 |  |

In the real world, many objects produce similar sounds. How to accurately recognize ambiguous sounds is a major challenge for audio captioning. In this work, inspired by inherent human multimodal perception, we propose visually-aware audio captioning, which makes use of visual information to help the description of ambiguous sounding objects. Specifically, we introduce an off-the-shelf visual encoder to extract video features and incorporate the visual features into an audio captioning system. Furthermore, to better exploit complementary audio-visual contexts, we propose an audio-visual attention mechanism that adaptively integrates audio and visual context and removes the redundant information in the latent space. Experimental results on AudioCaps, the largest audio captioning dataset, show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on machine translation metrics.</p></details> | 2023-05-30 | INTERSPEECH 2023 |

One of the problems in audio captioning is the lack of training data due to the difficulty in collecting audio-caption pairs by crawling the web. In this study, to overcome this problem, we propose to use a pre-trained large-scale language model. Since an audio input cannot be directly inputted into such a language model, we utilize guidance captions retrieved from a training dataset based on similarities that may exist in different audio. Then, the caption of the audio input is generated by using a pre-trained language model while referring to the guidance captions. Experimental results show that (i) the proposed method has succeeded to use a pre-trained language model for audio captioning, and (ii) the oracle performance of the pre-trained model-based caption generator was clearly better than that of the conventional method trained from scratch.</p></details> | 2020-12-15 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2021</p></details> |

Manual human intervention is needed to find any shortcomings of the caption. In this work, we introduce a metric which automatically identifies the shortcomings of an audio caption by detecting the misses and false alarms in a candidate caption with respect to a reference caption, and reports the recall, precision and F-score.

To address this limitation, we propose a preference-aligned audio captioning framework based on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). To effectively capture nuanced human preferences, we train a Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP)-based reward model using human-labeled pairwise preference data. This reward model is integrated into a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune any baseline captioning system without relying on ground-truth caption annotations. Extensive human evaluations across multiple datasets show that our method produces captions preferred over those from baseline models, particularly in cases where the baseline models fail to provide correct and natural captions. Furthermore, our framework achieves performance comparable to supervised approaches with ground-truth data, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning audio captioning with human preferences and its scalability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Crowdsourcing a Dataset of Audio Captions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09238v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio captioning is a novel field of multi-modal translation and it is the task of creating a textual description of the content of an audio signal (e.g. "people talking in a big room"). The creation of a dataset for this task requires a considerable amount of work, rendering the crowdsourcing a very attractive option. In this paper we present a three steps based framework for crowdsourcing an audio captioning dataset, based on concepts and practises followed for the creation of widely used image captioning and machine translations datasets. During the first step initial captions are gathered. A grammatically corrected and/or rephrased version of each initial caption is obtained in second step. Finally, the initial and edited captions are rated, keeping the top ones for the produced dataset. We objectively evaluate the impact of our framework during the process of creating an audio captioning dataset, in terms of diversity and amount of typographical errors in the obtained captions. The obtained results show that the resulting dataset has less typographical errors than the initial captions, and on average each sound in the produced dataset has captions with a Jaccard similarity of 0.24, roughly equivalent to two ten-word captions having in common four words with the same root, indicating that the captions are dissimilar while they still contain some of the same information.</p></details> | 2019-07-23 |  |

However, the development of audio captioning methods can be biased due to the limited availability and quality of text-audio data. This paper proposes a SynthAC framework, which leverages recent advances in audio generative models and commonly available text corpus to create synthetic text-audio pairs, thereby enhancing text-audio representation. Specifically, the text-to-audio generation model, i.e., AudioLDM, is used to generate synthetic audio signals with captions from an image captioning dataset. Our SynthAC expands the availability of well-annotated captions from the text-vision domain to audio captioning, thus enhancing text-audio representation by learning relations within synthetic text-audio pairs. Experiments demonstrate that our SynthAC framework can benefit audio captioning models by incorporating well-annotated text corpus from the text-vision domain, offering a promising solution to the challenge caused by data scarcity. Furthermore, SynthAC can be easily adapted to various state-of-the-art methods, leading to substantial performance improvements.</p></details> | 2023-09-19 |  |

Existing audio captioning models have shown promising improvement in recent years. However, these models are mostly trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE),which tends to make captions generic, simple and deterministic. As different people may describe an audio clip from different aspects using distinct words and grammars, we argue that an audio captioning system should have the ability to generate diverse captions for a fixed audio clip and across similar audio clips. To address this problem, we propose an adversarial training framework for audio captioning based on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), which aims at improving the naturalness and diversity of generated captions. Unlike processing data of continuous values in a classical GAN, a sentence is composed of discrete tokens and the discrete sampling process is non-differentiable. To address this issue, policy gradient, a reinforcement learning technique, is used to back-propagate the reward to the generator. The results show that our proposed model can generate more diverse captions, as compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 2022-03-30 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, accepted by ICASSP 2022</p></details> |

Existing audio captioning systems are generally based on an encoder-decoder architecture, in which acoustic information is extracted by an audio encoder and then a language decoder is used to generate the captions. Training an audio captioning system often encounters the problem of data scarcity. Transferring knowledge from pre-trained audio models such as Pre-trained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) have recently emerged as a useful method to mitigate this issue. However, there is less attention on exploiting pre-trained language models for the decoder, compared with the encoder. BERT is a pre-trained language model that has been extensively used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Nevertheless, the potential of BERT as the language decoder for audio captioning has not been investigated. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of the pre-trained BERT model for audio captioning. Specifically, we apply PANNs as the encoder and initialize the decoder from the public pre-trained BERT models. We conduct an empirical study on the use of these BERT models for the decoder in the audio captioning model. Our models achieve competitive results with the existing audio captioning methods on the AudioCaps dataset.</p></details> | 2022-03-29 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 30th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

ACES takes into account how human listeners parse semantic information from sounds, providing a novel and comprehensive evaluation perspective for automated audio captioning systems. ACES combines semantic similarities and semantic entity labeling.

As shown in the submissions received for Task 6 of the DCASE 2021 Challenges, this problem has received increasing interest in the community. The existing AAC systems are usually based on an encoder-decoder architecture, where the audio signal is encoded into a latent representation, and aligned with its corresponding text descriptions, then a decoder is used to generate the captions. However, training of an AAC system often encounters the problem of data scarcity, which may lead to inaccurate representation and audio-text alignment. To address this problem, we propose a novel encoder-decoder framework called Contrastive Loss for Audio Captioning (CL4AC). In CL4AC, the self-supervision signals derived from the original audio-text paired data are used to exploit the correspondences between audio and texts by contrasting samples, which can improve the quality of latent representation and the alignment between audio and texts, while trained with limited data.

This task has attracted increasing attention and substantial progress has been made in recent years. Captions generated by existing models are generally faithful to the content of audio clips, however, these machine-generated captions are often deterministic (e.g., generating a fixed caption for a given audio clip), simple (e.g., using common words and simple grammar), and generic (e.g., generating the same caption for similar audio clips). When people are asked to describe the content of an audio clip, different people tend to focus on different sound events and describe an audio clip diversely from various aspects using distinct words and grammar. We believe that an audio captioning system should have the ability to generate diverse captions, either for a fixed audio clip, or across similar audio clips. To this end, we propose an adversarial training framework based on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) to improve diversity of audio captioning systems. A caption generator and two hybrid discriminators compete and are learned jointly, where the caption generator can be any standard encoder-decoder captioning model used to generate captions, and the hybrid discriminators assess the generated captions from different criteria, such as their naturalness and semantics. We conduct experiments on the Clotho dataset. The results show that our proposed model can generate captions with better diversity as compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 2024-07-02 | Accepted to TASLP |

To evaluate the quality of generated audio captions, previous works directly adopt image captioning metrics like SPICE and CIDEr, without justifying their suitability in this new domain, which may mislead the development of advanced models. This problem is still unstudied due to the lack of human judgment datasets on caption quality. Therefore, we firstly construct two evaluation benchmarks, AudioCaps-Eval and Clotho-Eval. They are established with pairwise comparison instead of absolute rating to achieve better inter-annotator agreement. Current metrics are found in poor correlation with human annotations on these datasets. To overcome their limitations, we propose a metric named FENSE, where we combine the strength of Sentence-BERT in capturing similarity, and a novel Error Detector to penalize erroneous sentences for robustness. On the newly established benchmarks, FENSE outperforms current metrics by 14-25% accuracy.

Most of the existing research extracts acoustic features of audio clips as input to encoder-decoder and transformer architectures to produce the captions in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Due to data insufficiency and the architecture's inadequate learning capacity, additional information is needed to generate natural language sentences, as well as acoustic features. To address these problems, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed that learns from both acoustic features and extracted audio event labels as inputs. The proposed model is based on pre-trained acoustic features and audio event detection. Various experiments used different acoustic features, word embedding models, audio event label extraction methods, and implementation configurations to show which combinations have better performance on the audio captioning task. Results of the extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that using audio event labels with the acoustic features improves the recognition performance and the proposed method either outperforms or achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | 2022-04-20 | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing</p></details> |

However, the convolution operation used in PANNs is limited in capturing the long-time dependencies within an audio signal, thereby leading to potential performance degradation in audio captioning. This letter presents a novel method using graph attention (GraphAC) for encoder-decoder based audio captioning. In the encoder, a graph attention module is introduced after the PANNs to learn contextual association (i.e. the dependency among the audio features over different time frames) through an adjacency graph, and a top-k mask is used to mitigate the interference from noisy nodes. The learnt contextual association leads to a more effective feature representation with feature node aggregation. As a result, the decoder can predict important semantic information about the acoustic scene and events based on the contextual associations learned from the audio signal. Experimental results show that GraphAC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with PANNs as the encoders, thanks to the incorporation of the graph attention module into the encoder for capturing the long-time dependencies within the audio signal.

| **[CosyAudio: Improving Audio Generation with Confidence Scores and Synthetic Captions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16761v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation is an emerging area within AI-generated content (AIGC), where audio is created from natural language descriptions. Despite growing interest, developing robust TTA models remains challenging due to the scarcity of well-labeled datasets and the prevalence of noisy or inaccurate captions in large-scale, weakly labeled corpora. To address these challenges, we propose CosyAudio, a novel framework that utilizes confidence scores and synthetic captions to enhance the quality of audio generation. CosyAudio consists of two core components: AudioCapTeller and an audio generator. AudioCapTeller generates synthetic captions for audio and provides confidence scores to evaluate their accuracy. The audio generator uses these synthetic captions and confidence scores to enable quality-aware audio generation. Additionally, we introduce a self-evolving training strategy that iteratively optimizes CosyAudio across both well-labeled and weakly-labeled datasets. Initially trained with well-labeled data, AudioCapTeller leverages its assessment capabilities on weakly-labeled datasets for high-quality filtering and reinforcement learning, which further improves its performance. The well-trained AudioCapTeller refines corpora by generating new captions and confidence scores, serving for the audio generator training. Extensive experiments on open-source datasets demonstrate that CosyAudio outperforms existing models in automated audio captioning, generates more faithful audio, and exhibits strong generalization across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Transformer-based Audio Captioning Model with Keyword Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00222v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the problems with automated audio captioning (AAC) is the indeterminacy in word selection corresponding to the audio event/scene. Since one acoustic event/scene can be described with several words, it results in a combinatorial explosion of possible captions and difficulty in training. To solve this problem, we propose a Transformer-based audio-captioning model with keyword estimation called TRACKE. It simultaneously solves the word-selection indeterminacy problem with the main task of AAC while executing the sub-task of acoustic event detection/acoustic scene classification (i.e., keyword estimation). TRACKE estimates keywords, which comprise a word set corresponding to audio events/scenes in the input audio, and generates the caption while referring to the estimated keywords to reduce word-selection indeterminacy. Experimental results on a public AAC dataset indicate that TRACKE achieved state-of-the-art performance and successfully estimated both the caption and its keywords.</p></details> | 2020-08-11 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2020</p></details> |

| **[Multi-task Regularization Based on Infrequent Classes for Audio Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04660v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio captioning is a multi-modal task, focusing on using natural language for describing the contents of general audio. Most audio captioning methods are based on deep neural networks, employing an encoder-decoder scheme and a dataset with audio clips and corresponding natural language descriptions (i.e. captions). A significant challenge for audio captioning is the distribution of words in the captions: some words are very frequent but acoustically non-informative, i.e. the function words (e.g. "a", "the"), and other words are infrequent but informative, i.e. the content words (e.g. adjectives, nouns). In this paper we propose two methods to mitigate this class imbalance problem. First, in an autoencoder setting for audio captioning, we weigh each word's contribution to the training loss inversely proportional to its number of occurrences in the whole dataset. Secondly, in addition to multi-class, word-level audio captioning task, we define a multi-label side task based on clip-level content word detection by training a separate decoder. We use the loss from the second task to regularize the jointly trained encoder for the audio captioning task. We evaluate our method using Clotho, a recently published, wide-scale audio captioning dataset, and our results show an increase of 37\% relative improvement with SPIDEr metric over the baseline method.</p></details> | 2020-07-10 |  |
| **[Audio Caption in a Car Setting with a Sentence-Level Loss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13448v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Captioning has attracted much attention in image and video understanding while a small amount of work examines audio captioning. This paper contributes a Mandarin-annotated dataset for audio captioning within a car scene. A sentence-level loss is proposed to be used in tandem with a GRU encoder-decoder model to generate captions with higher semantic similarity to human annotations. We evaluate the model on the newly-proposed Car dataset, a previously published Mandarin Hospital dataset and the Joint dataset, indicating its generalization capability across different scenes. An improvement in all metrics can be observed, including classical natural language generation (NLG) metrics, sentence richness and human evaluation ratings. However, though detailed audio captions can now be automatically generated, human annotations still outperform model captions on many aspects.</p></details> | 2020-10-26 |  |
| **[Audio Difference Captioning Utilizing Similarity-Discrepancy Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11923v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC) as a new extension task of audio captioning for describing the semantic differences between input pairs of similar but slightly different audio clips. The ADC solves the problem that conventional audio captioning sometimes generates similar captions for similar audio clips, failing to describe the difference in content. We also propose a cross-attention-concentrated transformer encoder to extract differences by comparing a pair of audio clips and a similarity-discrepancy disentanglement to emphasize the difference in the latent space. To evaluate the proposed methods, we built an AudioDiffCaps dataset consisting of pairs of similar but slightly different audio clips with human-annotated descriptions of their differences. The experiment with the AudioDiffCaps dataset showed that the proposed methods solve the ADC task effectively and improve the attention weights to extract the difference by visualizing them in the transformer encoder.</p></details> | 2023-08-24 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DCASE2023 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Audio Representations for Automated Audio Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14989v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete audio representations, termed audio tokens, are broadly categorized into semantic and acoustic tokens, typically generated through unsupervised tokenization of continuous audio representations. However, their applicability to automated audio captioning (AAC) remains underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the viability of audio token-driven models for AAC through comparative analyses of various tokenization methods. Our findings reveal that audio tokenization leads to performance degradation in AAC models compared to those that directly utilize continuous audio representations. To address this issue, we introduce a supervised audio tokenizer trained with an audio tagging objective. Unlike unsupervised tokenizers, which lack explicit semantic understanding, the proposed tokenizer effectively captures audio event information. Experiments conducted on the Clotho dataset demonstrate that the proposed audio tokens outperform conventional audio tokens in the AAC task.</p></details> | 2025-05-22 | Interspeech 2025 |
| **[Zero-Shot Audio Captioning via Audibility Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03884v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of audio captioning is similar in essence to tasks such as image and video captioning. However, it has received much less attention. We propose three desiderata for captioning audio -- (i) fluency of the generated text, (ii) faithfulness of the generated text to the input audio, and the somewhat related (iii) audibility, which is the quality of being able to be perceived based only on audio. Our method is a zero-shot method, i.e., we do not learn to perform captioning. Instead, captioning occurs as an inference process that involves three networks that correspond to the three desired qualities: (i) A Large Language Model, in our case, for reasons of convenience, GPT-2, (ii) A model that provides a matching score between an audio file and a text, for which we use a multimodal matching network called ImageBind, and (iii) A text classifier, trained using a dataset we collected automatically by instructing GPT-4 with prompts designed to direct the generation of both audible and inaudible sentences. We present our results on the AudioCap dataset, demonstrating that audibility guidance significantly enhances performance compared to the baseline, which lacks this objective.</p></details> | 2023-09-08 |  |
| **[Towards Diverse and Efficient Audio Captioning via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09401v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Diffusion-based Audio Captioning (DAC), a non-autoregressive diffusion model tailored for diverse and efficient audio captioning. Although existing captioning models relying on language backbones have achieved remarkable success in various captioning tasks, their insufficient performance in terms of generation speed and diversity impede progress in audio understanding and multimedia applications. Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity. The success of DAC illustrates that text generation can also be seamlessly integrated with audio and visual generation tasks using a diffusion backbone, paving the way for a unified, audio-related generative model across different modalities.</p></details> | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/diffusion-audio-captioning</p></details> |
| **[AVCap: Leveraging Audio-Visual Features as Text Tokens for Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07801v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, advancements in representation learning and language models have propelled Automated Captioning (AC) to new heights, enabling the generation of human-level descriptions. Leveraging these advancements, we propose AVCap, an Audio-Visual Captioning framework, a simple yet powerful baseline approach applicable to audio-visual captioning. AVCap utilizes audio-visual features as text tokens, which has many advantages not only in performance but also in the extensibility and scalability of the model. AVCap is designed around three pivotal dimensions: the exploration of optimal audio-visual encoder architectures, the adaptation of pre-trained models according to the characteristics of generated text, and the investigation into the efficacy of modality fusion in captioning. Our method outperforms existing audio-visual captioning methods across all metrics and the code is available on https://github.com/JongSuk1/AVCap</p></details> | 2024-07-12 | Interspeech 2024 |
| **[Exploring the Role of Audio in Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.12559v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent focus in video captioning has been on designing architectures that can consume both video and text modalities, and using large-scale video datasets with text transcripts for pre-training, such as HowTo100M. Though these approaches have achieved significant improvement, the audio modality is often ignored in video captioning. In this work, we present an audio-visual framework, which aims to fully exploit the potential of the audio modality for captioning. Instead of relying on text transcripts extracted via automatic speech recognition (ASR), we argue that learning with raw audio signals can be more beneficial, as audio has additional information including acoustic events, speaker identity, etc. Our contributions are twofold. First, we observed that the model overspecializes to the audio modality when pre-training with both video and audio modality, since the ground truth (i.e., text transcripts) can be solely predicted using audio. We proposed a Modality Balanced Pre-training (MBP) loss to mitigate this issue and significantly improve the performance on downstream tasks. Second, we slice and dice different design choices of the cross-modal module, which may become an information bottleneck and generate inferior results. We proposed new local-global fusion mechanisms to improve information exchange across audio and video. We demonstrate significant improvements by leveraging the audio modality on four datasets, and even outperform the state of the art on some metrics without relying on the text modality as the input.</p></details> | 2023-06-23 |  |
| **[MusCaps: Generating Captions for Music Audio](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11984v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content-based music information retrieval has seen rapid progress with the adoption of deep learning. Current approaches to high-level music description typically make use of classification models, such as in auto-tagging or genre and mood classification. In this work, we propose to address music description via audio captioning, defined as the task of generating a natural language description of music audio content in a human-like manner. To this end, we present the first music audio captioning model, MusCaps, consisting of an encoder-decoder with temporal attention. Our method combines convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures to jointly process audio-text inputs through a multimodal encoder and leverages pre-training on audio data to obtain representations that effectively capture and summarise musical features in the input. Evaluation of the generated captions through automatic metrics shows that our method outperforms a baseline designed for non-music audio captioning. Through an ablation study, we unveil that this performance boost can be mainly attributed to pre-training of the audio encoder, while other design choices - modality fusion, decoding strategy and the use of attention - contribute only marginally. Our model represents a shift away from classification-based music description and combines tasks requiring both auditory and linguistic understanding to bridge the semantic gap in music information retrieval.</p></details> | 2021-12-09 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2021 for the Special Session on Representation Learning for Audio, Speech, and Music Processing</p></details> |
| **[Local Information Assisted Attention-free Decoder for Audio Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03217v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated audio captioning aims to describe audio data with captions using natural language. Existing methods often employ an encoder-decoder structure, where the attention-based decoder (e.g., Transformer decoder) is widely used and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Although this method effectively captures global information within audio data via the self-attention mechanism, it may ignore the event with short time duration, due to its limitation in capturing local information in an audio signal, leading to inaccurate prediction of captions. To address this issue, we propose a method using the pretrained audio neural networks (PANNs) as the encoder and local information assisted attention-free Transformer (LocalAFT) as the decoder. The novelty of our method is in the proposal of the LocalAFT decoder, which allows local information within an audio signal to be captured while retaining the global information. This enables the events of different duration, including short duration, to be captured for more precise caption generation. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in Task 6 of the DCASE 2021 Challenge with the standard attention-based decoder for caption generation.</p></details> | 2022-08-10 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Signal Processing Letters</p></details> |
| **[MiDashengLM: Efficient Audio Understanding with General Audio Captions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03983v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches for large audio language models (LALMs) often rely on closed data sources or proprietary models, limiting their generalization and accessibility. This paper introduces MiDashengLM, a novel open audio-language model designed for efficient and comprehensive audio understanding through the use of general audio captions using our novel ACAVCaps training dataset. MiDashengLM exclusively relies on publicly available pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility. At its core, MiDashengLM integrates Dasheng, an open-source audio encoder, specifically engineered to process diverse auditory information effectively. Unlike previous works primarily focused on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based audio-text alignment, our strategy centers on general audio captions, fusing speech, sound and music information into one textual representation, enabling a holistic textual representation of complex audio scenes. Lastly, MiDashengLM provides an up to 4x speedup in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT) and up to 20x higher throughput than comparable models.

| **[Enhance Temporal Relations in Audio Captioning with Sound Event Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01533v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated audio captioning aims at generating natural language descriptions for given audio clips, not only detecting and classifying sounds, but also summarizing the relationships between audio events. Recent research advances in audio captioning have introduced additional guidance to improve the accuracy of audio events in generated sentences. However, temporal relations between audio events have received little attention while revealing complex relations is a key component in summarizing audio content. Therefore, this paper aims to better capture temporal relationships in caption generation with sound event detection (SED), a task that locates events' timestamps. We investigate the best approach to integrate temporal information in a captioning model and propose a temporal tag system to transform the timestamps into comprehensible relations. Results evaluated by the proposed temporal metrics suggest that great improvement is achieved in terms of temporal relation generation.</p></details> | 2024-07-19 | Interspeech 2023 |
| **[Estimated Audio-Caption Correspondences Improve Language-Based Audio Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11641v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dual-encoder-based audio retrieval systems are commonly optimized with contrastive learning on a set of matching and mismatching audio-caption pairs. This leads to a shared embedding space in which corresponding items from the two modalities end up close together. Since audio-caption datasets typically only contain matching pairs of recordings and descriptions, it has become common practice to create mismatching pairs by pairing the audio with a caption randomly drawn from the dataset. This is not ideal because the randomly sampled caption could, just by chance, partly or entirely describe the audio recording. However, correspondence information for all possible pairs is costly to annotate and thus typically unavailable; we, therefore, suggest substituting it with estimated correspondences. To this end, we propose a two-staged training procedure in which multiple retrieval models are first trained as usual, i.e., without estimated correspondences. In the second stage, the audio-caption correspondences predicted by these models then serve as prediction targets. We evaluate our method on the ClothoV2 and the AudioCaps benchmark and show that it improves retrieval performance, even in a restricting self-distillation setting where a single model generates and then learns from the estimated correspondences. We further show that our method outperforms the current state of the art by 1.6 pp. mAP@10 on the ClothoV2 benchmark.</p></details> | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events, DCASE, Tokyo, Japan, 2024.

| **[EmotionCaps: Enhancing Audio Captioning Through Emotion-Augmented Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12028v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in audio-language modeling, such as automated audio captioning, has benefited from training on synthetic data generated with the aid of large-language models. However, such approaches for environmental sound captioning have primarily focused on audio event tags and have not explored leveraging emotional information that may be present in recordings. In this work, we explore the benefit of generating emotion-augmented synthetic audio caption data by instructing ChatGPT with additional acoustic information in the form of estimated soundscape emotion. To do so, we introduce EmotionCaps, an audio captioning dataset comprised of approximately 120,000 audio clips with paired synthetic descriptions enriched with soundscape emotion recognition (SER) information. We hypothesize that this additional information will result in higher-quality captions that match the emotional tone of the audio recording, which will, in turn, improve the performance of captioning models trained with this data. We test this hypothesis through both objective and subjective evaluation, comparing models trained with the EmotionCaps dataset to multiple baseline models. Our findings challenge current approaches to captioning and suggest new directions for developing and assessing captioning models.</p></details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[Parameter Efficient Audio Captioning With Faithful Guidance Using Audio-text Shared Latent Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03340v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been significant research on developing pretrained transformer architectures for multimodal-to-text generation tasks. Albeit performance improvements, such models are frequently overparameterized, hence suffer from hallucination and large memory footprint making them challenging to deploy on edge devices. In this paper, we address both these issues for the application of automated audio captioning. First, we propose a data augmentation technique for generating hallucinated audio captions and show that similarity based on an audio-text shared latent space is suitable for detecting hallucination. Then, we propose a parameter efficient inference time faithful decoding algorithm that enables smaller audio captioning models with performance equivalent to larger models trained with more data. During the beam decoding step, the smaller model utilizes an audio-text shared latent representation to semantically align the generated text with corresponding input audio. Faithful guidance is introduced into the beam probability by incorporating the cosine similarity between latent representation projections of greedy rolled out intermediate beams and audio clip. We show the efficacy of our algorithm on benchmark datasets and evaluate the proposed scheme against baselines using conventional audio captioning and semantic similarity metrics while illustrating tradeoffs between performance and complexity.</p></details> | 2023-09-08 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

One challenge of audio captioning is the difficulty of the generalization due to the lack of audio-text paired training data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method of dealing with small-scaled datasets by leveraging a pre-trained language model. We keep the language model frozen to maintain the expressivity for text generation, and we only learn to extract global and temporal features from the input audio. To bridge a modality gap between the audio features and the language model, we employ mapping networks that translate audio features to the continuous vectors the language model can understand, called prefixes. We evaluate our proposed method on the Clotho and AudioCaps dataset and show our method outperforms prior arts in diverse experimental settings.</p></details> | 2023-04-05 | ICASSP 2023 |
| **[Temporal Sub-sampling of Audio Feature Sequences for Automated Audio Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02676v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio captioning is the task of automatically creating a textual description for the contents of a general audio signal. Typical audio captioning methods rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), where the target of the DNN is to map the input audio sequence to an output sequence of words, i.e. the caption. Though, the length of the textual description is considerably less than the length of the audio signal, for example 10 words versus some thousands of audio feature vectors. This clearly indicates that an output word corresponds to multiple input feature vectors. In this work we present an approach that focuses on explicitly taking advantage of this difference of lengths between sequences, by applying a temporal sub-sampling to the audio input sequence. We employ a sequence-to-sequence method, which uses a fixed-length vector as an output from the encoder, and we apply temporal sub-sampling between the RNNs of the encoder. We evaluate the benefit of our approach by employing the freely available dataset Clotho and we evaluate the impact of different factors of temporal sub-sampling. Our results show an improvement to all considered metrics.</p></details> | 2020-07-08 |  |

The encoder is a multi-layered, bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) and the decoder a multi-layered GRU with a classification layer connected to the last GRU of the decoder. The classification layer and the alignment model are fully connected layers with shared weights between timesteps. The proposed method is evaluated using data drawn from a commercial sound effects library, ProSound Effects.

However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts, leading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem stems from the simplicity and scarcity of the training data. This work aims to create a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio generation models. We first develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed captions by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging labels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). The resulting dataset, Sound-VECaps, comprises 1.66M high-quality audio-caption pairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and environment information. We then demonstrate that training the text-to-audio generation models with Sound-VECaps significantly improves the performance on complex prompts. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of the models on several downstream audio-language tasks, showing the potential of Sound-VECaps in advancing audio-text representation learning.

Most end-to-end monaural speech recognition systems either remove these background sounds using speech enhancement or train noise-robust models. For better model interpretability and holistic understanding, we aim to bring together the growing field of automated audio captioning (AAC) and the thoroughly studied automatic speech recognition (ASR). The goal of AAC is to generate natural language descriptions of contents in audio samples. We propose several approaches for end-to-end joint modeling of ASR and AAC tasks and demonstrate their advantages over traditional approaches, which model these tasks independently. A major hurdle in evaluating our proposed approach is the lack of labeled audio datasets with both speech transcriptions and audio captions. Therefore we also create a multi-task dataset by mixing the clean speech Wall Street Journal corpus with multiple levels of background noises chosen from the AudioCaps dataset. We also perform extensive experimental evaluation and show improvements of our proposed methods as compared to existing state-of-the-art ASR and AAC methods.</p></details> | 2022-02-04 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures.

In this paper we propose a full Transformer architecture that utilizes Patchout as proposed in [1], significantly reducing the computational complexity and avoiding overfitting. The caption generation is partly conditioned on textual AudioSet tags extracted by a pre-trained classification model which is fine-tuned to maximize the semantic similarity between AudioSet labels and ground truth captions. To mitigate the data scarcity problem of Automated Audio Captioning we introduce transfer learning from an upstream audio-related task and an enlarged in-domain dataset. Moreover, we propose a method to apply Mixup augmentation for AAC. Ablation studies are carried out to investigate how Patchout and text guidance contribute to the final performance.

| **[Zero-Shot Audio Captioning Using Soft and Hard Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06295v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traditional audio captioning methods, a model is usually trained in a fully supervised manner using a human-annotated dataset containing audio-text pairs and then evaluated on the test sets from the same dataset. Such methods have two limitations. First, these methods are often data-hungry and require time-consuming and expensive human annotations to obtain audio-text pairs. Second, these models often suffer from performance degradation in cross-domain scenarios, i.e., when the input audio comes from a different domain than the training set, which, however, has received little attention. We propose an effective audio captioning method based on the contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) model to address these issues. Our proposed method requires only textual data for training, enabling the model to generate text from the textual feature in the cross-modal semantic space.In the inference stage, the model generates the descriptive text for the given audio from the audio feature by leveraging the audio-text alignment from CLAP.We devise two strategies to mitigate the discrepancy between text and audio embeddings: a mixed-augmentation-based soft prompt and a retrieval-based acoustic-aware hard prompt. These approaches are designed to enhance the generalization performance of our proposed model, facilitating the model to generate captions more robustly and accurately. Extensive experiments on AudioCaps and Clotho benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms other zero-shot audio captioning approaches for in-domain scenarios and outperforms the compared methods for cross-domain scenarios, underscoring the generalization ability of our method.</p></details> | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing</p></details> |

However, researchers face challenges due to the costly and time-consuming collection process of existing audio-language datasets, which are limited in size. To address this data scarcity issue, we introduce WavCaps, the first large-scale weakly-labelled audio captioning dataset, comprising approximately 400k audio clips with paired captions. We sourced audio clips and their raw descriptions from web sources and a sound event detection dataset. However, the online-harvested raw descriptions are highly noisy and unsuitable for direct use in tasks such as automated audio captioning. To overcome this issue, we propose a three-stage processing pipeline for filtering noisy data and generating high-quality captions, where ChatGPT, a large language model, is leveraged to filter and transform raw descriptions automatically. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of WavCaps dataset and evaluate it on multiple downstream audio-language multimodal learning tasks. The systems trained on WavCaps outperform previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by a significant margin. Our aspiration is for the WavCaps dataset we have proposed to facilitate research in audio-language multimodal learning and demonstrate the potential of utilizing ChatGPT to enhance academic research. Our dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/XinhaoMei/WavCaps.</p></details> | 2024-07-22 | Accepted to TASLP |

It is an essential multimodal task in which auditory and visual contents are equally important. Although audio information has been exploited to improve video captioning in previous works, it is usually regarded as an additional feature fed into a black box fusion machine. How are the words in the generated sentences associated with the auditory and visual modalities? The problem is still not investigated. In this paper, we make the first attempt to design an interpretable audio-visual video captioning network to discover the association between words in sentences and audio-visual sequences. To achieve this, we propose a multimodal convolutional neural network-based audio-visual video captioning framework and introduce a modality-aware module for exploring modality selection during sentence generation. Besides, we collect new audio captioning and visual captioning datasets for further exploring the interactions between auditory and visual modalities for high-level video understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the modality-aware module makes our model interpretable on modality selection during sentence generation. Even with the added interpretability, our video captioning network can still achieve comparable performance with recent state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 2018-12-10 | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Existing contrastive language-audio pretrained models are typically trained using global, clip-level descriptions, which provide only weak temporal supervision. We hypothesize that CLAP-like language-audio models - particularly, if they are expected to produce frame-level embeddings - can benefit from a stronger temporal supervision. To confirm our hypothesis, we curate a novel dataset of approximately 12,000 audio recordings from Freesound, each annotated with single-sentence free-text descriptions linked to a specific temporal segment in an audio recording. We use large language models to clean these annotations by removing references to non-audible events, transcribed speech, typos, and annotator language bias. We further propose a frame-wise contrastive training strategy that learns to align text descriptions with temporal regions in an audio recording and demonstrate that our model has better temporal text-audio alignment abilities compared to models trained only on global captions when evaluated on the AudioSet Strong benchmark. The dataset and our source code are available on Zenodo and GitHub, respectively.</p></details> | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA), 2025.

However, grounding the actual sound events in the given audio based on its corresponding caption has not been investigated. This paper contributes an AudioGrounding dataset, which provides the correspondence between sound events and the captions provided in Audiocaps, along with the location (timestamps) of each present sound event. Based on such, we propose the text-to-audio grounding (TAG) task, which interactively considers the relationship between audio processing and language understanding. A baseline approach is provided, resulting in an event-F1 score of 28.3% and a Polyphonic Sound Detection Score (PSDS) score of 14.7%.</p></details> | 2021-02-24 |  |

Existing datasets provide audio-caption pairs, with captions written in English only. In this work, we explore multilingual AAC, using machine translated captions. We translated automatically two prominent AAC datasets, AudioCaps and Clotho, from English to French, German and Spanish. We trained and evaluated monolingual systems in the four languages, on AudioCaps and Clotho. In all cases, the models achieved similar performance, about 75% CIDEr on AudioCaps and 43% on Clotho. In French, we acquired manual captions of the AudioCaps eval subset. The French system, trained on the machine translated version of AudioCaps, achieved significantly better results on the manual eval subset, compared to the English system for which we automatically translated the outputs to French. This advocates in favor of building systems in a target language instead of simply translating to a target language the English captions from the English system. Finally, we built a multilingual model, which achieved results in each language comparable to each monolingual system, while using much less parameters than using a collection of monolingual systems.</p></details> | 2023-09-15 |  |

While recent methods have improved performance through sophisticated modality fusion, it remains unclear to what extent the two modalities are complementary in current audio-visual captioning models and how robust these models are when one modality is degraded. We address these questions by conducting systematic modality robustness tests on LAVCap, a state-of-the-art audio-visual captioning model, in which we selectively suppress or corrupt the audio or visual streams to quantify sensitivity and complementarity. The analysis reveals a pronounced bias toward the audio stream in LAVCap. To evaluate how balanced audio-visual captioning models are in their use of both modalities, we augment AudioCaps with textual annotations that jointly describe the audio and visual streams, yielding the AudioVisualCaps dataset. In our experiments, we report LAVCap baseline results on AudioVisualCaps. We also evaluate the model under modality robustness tests on AudioVisualCaps and the results indicate that LAVCap trained on AudioVisualCaps exhibits less modality bias than when trained on AudioCaps.</p></details> | 2025-10-29 | under review |

Audio captioning is a recent addition to the domain of audio analytics, a cross-modal translation task that focuses on generating natural descriptions from sound events occurring in an audio stream. In this work, we identify and improve on three main challenges in automated audio captioning: i) data scarcity, ii) imbalance or limitations in the audio captions vocabulary, and iii) the proper performance evaluation metric that can best capture both auditory and semantic characteristics. We find that generally adopted loss functions can result in an unfair vocabulary imbalance during model training. We propose two audio captioning augmentation methods that enrich the training dataset and the vocabulary size. We further underline the need for in-domain pretraining by exploring the suitability of audio encoders that were previously trained on different audio tasks. Finally, we systematically explore five performance metrics borrowed from the image captioning domain and highlight their limitations for the audio domain.</p></details> | 2023-05-04 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EUSIPCO 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-modal interaction (HCI) method for ATR by simultaneously exploring clip-sentence, segment-phrase, and frame-word relationships, achieving a comprehensive multi-modal semantic comparison. Besides, we also present a novel ATR framework that leverages auxiliary captions (AC) generated by a pretrained captioner to perform feature interaction between audio and generated captions, which yields enhanced audio representations and is complementary to the original ATR matching branch. The audio and generated captions can also form new audio-text pairs as data augmentation for training. Experiments show that our HCI significantly improves the ATR performance. Moreover, our AC framework also shows stable performance gains on multiple datasets.</p></details> | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech2023</p></details> |

To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.</p></details> | 2025-09-23 |  |

To overcome this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models, eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt, which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no keyword list is used.</p></details> | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The 26th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE), scheduled for 15-17 December 2025 in Marrakech, Morocco</p></details> |

Unlike NL text generation tasks, which rely on metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR based on lexical semantics for evaluation, the AAC evaluation metric requires an ability to map NL text (phrases) that correspond to similar sounds in addition lexical semantics. Current metrics used for evaluation of AAC tasks lack an understanding of the perceived properties of sound represented by text. In this paper, wepropose a novel metric based on Text-to-Audio Grounding (TAG), which is, useful for evaluating cross modal tasks like AAC. Experiments on publicly available AAC data-set shows our evaluation metric to perform better compared to existing metrics used in NL text and image captioning literature.</p></details> | 2022-10-13 | 9 pages, 8 figures, |

This paper presents an audio captioning system with an encoder-decoder architecture, where the decoder predicts words based on audio features extracted by the encoder. To improve the proposed system, transfer learning from either an upstream audio-related task or a large in-domain dataset is introduced to mitigate the problem induced by data scarcity. Besides, evaluation metrics are incorporated into the optimization of the model with reinforcement learning, which helps address the problem of ``exposure bias'' induced by ``teacher forcing'' training strategy and the mismatch between the evaluation metrics and the loss function. The resulting system was ranked 3rd in DCASE 2021 Task 6. Ablation studies are carried out to investigate how much each element in the proposed system can contribute to final performance.

However, current methods often fail to effectively fuse audio and visual data, missing important semantic cues from each modality. To address this, we introduce LAVCap, a large language model (LLM)-based audio-visual captioning framework that effectively integrates visual information with audio to improve audio captioning performance. LAVCap employs an optimal transport-based alignment loss to bridge the modality gap between audio and visual features, enabling more effective semantic extraction. Additionally, we propose an optimal transport attention module that enhances audio-visual fusion using an optimal transport assignment map. Combined with the optimal training strategy, experimental results demonstrate that each component of our framework is effective.

Most prior works usually extract single-modality acoustic features and are therefore sub-optimal for the cross-modal decoding task. In this work, we propose a novel AAC system called CLIP-AAC to learn interactive cross-modality representation with both acoustic and textual information. Specifically, the proposed CLIP-AAC introduces an audio-head and a text-head in the pre-trained encoder to extract audio-text information. Furthermore, we also apply contrastive learning to narrow the domain difference by learning the correspondence between the audio signal and its paired captions. Experimental results show that the proposed CLIP-AAC approach surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin on the Clotho dataset in terms of NLP evaluation metrics. The ablation study indicates that both the pre-trained model and contrastive learning contribute to the performance gain of the AAC model.</p></details> | 2022-04-13 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Interspeech 2022</p></details> |

AAC systems take as input an audio signal and output a free-form text sentence, called a caption. Evaluating such systems is not trivial, since there are many ways to express the same idea. For this reason, several complementary metrics, such as BLEU, CIDEr, SPICE and SPIDEr, are used to compare a single automatic caption to one or several captions of reference, produced by a human annotator. Nevertheless, an automatic system can produce several caption candidates, either using some randomness in the sentence generation process, or by considering the various competing hypothesized captions during decoding with beam-search, for instance. If we consider an end-user of an AAC system, presenting several captions instead of a single one seems relevant to provide some diversity, similarly to information retrieval systems. In this work, we explore the possibility to consider several predicted captions in the evaluation process instead of one. For this purpose, we propose SPIDEr-max, a metric that takes the maximum SPIDEr value among the scores of several caption candidates. To advocate for our metric, we report experiments on Clotho v2.1 and AudioCaps, with a transformed-based system. On AudioCaps for example, this system reached a SPIDEr-max value (with 5 candidates) close to the SPIDEr human score of reference.</p></details> | 2022-11-17 | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE 2022), Nov 2022, Nancy, France</p></details> |

Existing AAC models achieve good results but only use the high-dimensional representation of the encoder. There is always insufficient information learning of high-dimensional methods owing to high-dimensional representations having a large amount of information. In this paper, a new encoder-decoder model called the Low- and High-Dimensional Feature Fusion (LHDFF) is proposed. LHDFF uses a new PANNs encoder called Residual PANNs (RPANNs) to fuse low- and high-dimensional features. Low-dimensional features contain limited information about specific audio scenes. The fusion of low- and high-dimensional features can improve model performance by repeatedly emphasizing specific audio scene information. To fully exploit the fused features, LHDFF uses a dual transformer decoder structure to generate captions in parallel.

In such scenarios, we propose a new task of AAC error correction and hope to reduce such errors by post-processing AAC outputs. To tackle this problem, we use observation-based rules to corrupt captions without errors, for pseudo grammatically-erroneous sentence generation. One pair of corrupted and clean sentences can thus be used for training. We train a neural network-based model on the synthetic error dataset and apply the model to correct real errors in AAC outputs.

Prior works propose the contrastive method to deal with caption degeneration. However, the contrastive method ignores the temporal information when measuring similarity across acoustic and linguistic modalities, leading to inferior performance. In this work, we develop the temporal-similarity score by introducing the unbiased sliced Wasserstein RBF (USW-RBF) kernel equipped with rotary positional embedding to account for temporal information across modalities. In contrast to the conventional sliced Wasserstein RBF kernel, we can form an unbiased estimation of USW-RBF kernel via Monte Carlo estimation. Therefore, it is well-suited to stochastic gradient optimization algorithms, and its approximation error decreases at a parametric rate of $\mathcal{O}(L^{-1/2})$ with $L$ Monte Carlo samples. Additionally, we introduce an audio captioning framework based on the unbiased sliced Wasserstein kernel, incorporating stochastic decoding methods to mitigate caption degeneration during the generation process. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two datasets, AudioCaps and Clotho, to illustrate the capability of generating high-quality audio captions. Experimental results show that our framework is able to increase caption length, lexical diversity, and text-to-audio self-retrieval accuracy.</p></details> | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

Having attracted attention only recently, very few works on AAC study the performance of existing pre-trained audio and natural language processing resources. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf models with a Transformer-based captioning approach. We utilize the freely available Clotho dataset to compare four different pre-trained machine listening models, four word embedding models, and their combinations in many different settings. Our evaluation suggests that YAMNet combined with BERT embeddings produces the best captions. Moreover, in general, fine-tuning pre-trained word embeddings can lead to better performance.

Utilizing multi-encoder transformer architectures, which have previously been employed to introduce vision-related information in the context of sound event detection, we analyze the usefulness of incorporating a variety of pretrained features. We perform experiments on a YouTube-based audiovisual data set and investigate the effect of applying the considered transfer learning technique in terms of a variety of captioning metrics. We find that only one of the considered kinds of pretrained features provides consistent improvements, while the others do not provide any noteworthy gains at all. Interestingly, the outcomes of prior research efforts indicate that the exact opposite is true in the case of sound event detection, leading us to conclude that the optimal choice of visual embeddings is strongly dependent on the task at hand. More specifically, visual features focusing on semantics appear appropriate in the context of automated audio captioning, while for sound event detection, time information seems to be more important.</p></details> | 2023-02-22 |  |

Drawing inspiration from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2) FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with superior audio-text alignment and instruction following.

However, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming to collect a sufficient number of paired audio and captions. Motivated by the recent advances in Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), we propose a weakly-supervised approach to train an AAC model assuming only text data and a pre-trained CLAP model, alleviating the need for paired target data. Our approach leverages the similarity between audio and text embeddings in CLAP. During training, we learn to reconstruct the text from the CLAP text embedding, and during inference, we decode using the audio embeddings. To mitigate the modality gap between the audio and text embeddings we employ strategies to bridge the gap during training and inference stages. We evaluate our proposed method on Clotho and AudioCaps datasets demonstrating its ability to achieve a relative performance of up to ~$83\%$ compared to fully supervised approaches trained with paired target data.</p></details> | 2023-09-22 | DCASE Workshop 2023 |

| **[Automated Audio Captioning via Fusion of Low- and High- Dimensional Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05037v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated audio captioning (AAC) aims to describe the content of an audio clip using simple sentences. Existing AAC methods are developed based on an encoder-decoder architecture that success is attributed to the use of a pre-trained CNN10 called PANNs as the encoder to learn rich audio representations. AAC is a highly challenging task due to its high-dimensional talent space involves audio of various scenarios. Existing methods only use the high-dimensional representation of the PANNs as the input of the decoder. However, the low-dimension representation may retain as much audio information as the high-dimensional representation may be neglected. In addition, although the high-dimensional approach may predict the audio captions by learning from existing audio captions, which lacks robustness and efficiency. To deal with these challenges, a fusion model which integrates low- and high-dimensional features AAC framework is proposed. In this paper, a new encoder-decoder framework is proposed called the Low- and High-Dimensional Feature Fusion (LHDFF) model for AAC. Moreover, in LHDFF, a new PANNs encoder is proposed called Residual PANNs (RPANNs) by fusing the low-dimensional feature from the intermediate convolution layer output and the high-dimensional feature from the final layer output of PANNs. To fully explore the information of the low- and high-dimensional fusion feature and high-dimensional feature respectively, we proposed dual transformer decoder structures to generate the captions in parallel. Especially, a probabilistic fusion approach is proposed that can ensure the overall performance of the system is improved by concentrating on the respective advantages of the two transformer decoders. Experimental results show that LHDFF achieves the best performance on the Clotho and AudioCaps datasets compared with other existing models</p></details> | 2022-10-18 |  |
| **[DRCap: Decoding CLAP Latents with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Zero-shot Audio Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09472v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While automated audio captioning (AAC) has made notable progress, traditional fully supervised AAC models still face two critical challenges: the need for expensive audio-text pair data for training and performance degradation when transferring across domains. To overcome these limitations, we present DRCap, a data-efficient and flexible zero-shot audio captioning system that requires text-only data for training and can quickly adapt to new domains without additional fine-tuning. DRCap integrates a contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) model and a large-language model (LLM) as its backbone. During training, the model predicts the ground-truth caption with a fixed text encoder from CLAP, whereas, during inference, the text encoder is replaced with the audio encoder to generate captions for audio clips in a zero-shot manner. To mitigate the modality gap of the CLAP model, we use both the projection strategy from the encoder side and the retrieval-augmented generation strategy from the decoder side. Specifically, audio embeddings are first projected onto a text embedding support to absorb extensive semantic information within the joint multi-modal space of CLAP. At the same time, similar captions retrieved from a datastore are fed as prompts to instruct the LLM, incorporating external knowledge to take full advantage of its strong generative capability. Conditioned on both the projected CLAP embedding and the retrieved similar captions, the model is able to produce a more accurate and semantically rich textual description. By tailoring the text embedding support and the caption datastore to the target domain, DRCap acquires a robust ability to adapt to new domains in a training-free manner. Experimental results demonstrate that DRCap outperforms all other zero-shot models in in-domain scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> | 2025-01-07 |  |
| **[An Eye for an Ear: Zero-shot Audio Description Leveraging an Image Captioner using Audiovisual Distribution Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05997v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models have fueled progress in image captioning. These models, fine-tuned on vast image datasets, exhibit a deep understanding of semantic concepts. In this work, we show that this ability can be re-purposed for audio captioning, where the joint image-language decoder can be leveraged to describe auditory content associated with image sequences within videos featuring audiovisual content. This can be achieved via multimodal alignment. Yet, this multimodal alignment task is non-trivial due to the inherent disparity between audible and visible elements in real-world videos. Moreover, multimodal representation learning often relies on contrastive learning, facing the challenge of the so-called modality gap which hinders smooth integration between modalities. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology for bridging the audiovisual modality gap by matching the distributions of tokens produced by an audio backbone and those of an image captioner. Our approach aligns the audio token distribution with that of the image tokens, enabling the model to perform zero-shot audio captioning in an unsupervised fashion while keeping the initial image captioning component unaltered. This alignment allows for the use of either audio or audiovisual input by combining or substituting the image encoder with the aligned audio encoder. Our method achieves significantly improved performances in zero-shot audio captioning, compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 2024-10-10 |  |

Most AAC methods are adapted from from image captioning of machine translation fields. In this work we present a novel AAC novel method, explicitly focused on the exploitation of the temporal and time-frequency patterns in audio. We employ three learnable processes for audio encoding, two for extracting the local and temporal information, and one to merge the output of the previous two processes. To generate the caption, we employ the widely used Transformer decoder. We assess our method utilizing the freely available splits of Clotho dataset.

| **[CoNeTTE: An efficient Audio Captioning system leveraging multiple datasets with Task Embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00454v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) involves generating natural language descriptions of audio content, using encoder-decoder architectures. An audio encoder produces audio embeddings fed to a decoder, usually a Transformer decoder, for caption generation. In this work, we describe our model, which novelty, compared to existing models, lies in the use of a ConvNeXt architecture as audio encoder, adapted from the vision domain to audio classification. This model, called CNext-trans, achieved state-of-the-art scores on the AudioCaps (AC) dataset and performed competitively on Clotho (CL), while using four to forty times fewer parameters than existing models. We examine potential biases in the AC dataset due to its origin from AudioSet by investigating unbiased encoder's impact on performance. Using the well-known PANN's CNN14, for instance, as an unbiased encoder, we observed a 1.7% absolute reduction in SPIDEr score (where higher scores indicate better performance). To improve cross-dataset performance, we conducted experiments by combining multiple AAC datasets (AC, CL, MACS, WavCaps) for training. Although this strategy enhanced overall model performance across datasets, it still fell short compared to models trained specifically on a single target dataset, indicating the absence of a one-size-fits-all model. To mitigate performance gaps between datasets, we introduced a Task Embedding (TE) token, allowing the model to identify the source dataset for each input sample. We provide insights into the impact of these TEs on both the form (words) and content (sound event types) of the generated captions. The resulting model, named CoNeTTE, an unbiased CNext-trans model enriched with dataset-specific Task Embeddings, achieved SPIDEr scores of 44.1% and 30.5% on AC and CL, respectively.

| **[Killing two birds with one stone: Can an audio captioning system also be used for audio-text retrieval?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15090v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) aims to develop systems capable of describing an audio recording using a textual sentence. In contrast, Audio-Text Retrieval (ATR) systems seek to find the best matching audio recording(s) for a given textual query (Text-to-Audio) or vice versa (Audio-to-Text). These tasks require different types of systems: AAC employs a sequence-to-sequence model, while ATR utilizes a ranking model that compares audio and text representations within a shared projection subspace. However, this work investigates the relationship between AAC and ATR by exploring the ATR capabilities of an unmodified AAC system, without fine-tuning for the new task. Our AAC system consists of an audio encoder (ConvNeXt-Tiny) trained on AudioSet for audio tagging, and a transformer decoder responsible for generating sentences. For AAC, it achieves a high SPIDEr-FL score of 0.298 on Clotho and 0.472 on AudioCaps on average. For ATR, we propose using the standard Cross-Entropy loss values obtained for any audio/caption pair. Experimental results on the Clotho and AudioCaps datasets demonstrate decent recall values using this simple approach. For instance, we obtained a Text-to-Audio R@1 value of 0.382 for Au-dioCaps, which is above the current state-of-the-art method without external data. Interestingly, we observe that normalizing the loss values was necessary for Audio-to-Text retrieval.</p></details> | 2023-08-30 | <details><summary>cam r...</summary><p>cam ready version (14/08/23)</p></details> |

To address this, we propose some metrics to elicit the model's confidence in its own generation. To assess how well these metrics replace correctness measures that leverage reference captions, we test their calibration with correctness measures. We discuss why some of these confidence metrics align better with certain correctness measures. Further, we provide insight into why temperature scaling of confidence metrics is effective. Our main contribution is a suite of well-calibrated lightweight confidence metrics for reference-free evaluation of captions in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | 2024-12-05 |  |

Evaluating these machine-generated audio captions is a complex task that requires considering diverse factors, among them, auditory scene understanding, sound-object inference, temporal coherence, and the environmental context of the scene. While current methods focus on specific aspects, they often fail to provide an overall score that aligns well with human judgment. In this work, we propose CLAIR-A, a simple and flexible method that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate audio captions by directly asking LLMs for a semantic distance score. In our evaluations, CLAIR-A better predicts human judgements of quality compared to traditional metrics, with a 5.8% relative accuracy improvement compared to the domain-specific FENSE metric and up to 11% over the best general-purpose measure on the Clotho-Eval dataset. Moreover, CLAIR-A offers more transparency by allowing the language model to explain the reasoning behind its scores, with these explanations rated up to 30% better by human evaluators than those provided by baseline methods.

Multitudinous concepts are described in an audio caption, ranging from local information such as sound events to global information like acoustic scenery. Currently, the mainstream paradigm for AAC is the end-to-end encoder-decoder architecture, expecting the encoder to learn all levels of concepts embedded in the audio automatically. This paper first proposes a topic model for audio descriptions, comprehensively analyzing the hierarchical audio topics that are commonly covered. We then explore a transfer learning scheme to access local and global information. Two source tasks are identified to respectively represent local and global information, being Audio Tagging (AT) and Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC). Experiments are conducted on the AAC benchmark dataset Clotho and Audiocaps, amounting to a vast increase in all eight metrics with topic transfer learning. Further, it is discovered that local information and abstract representation learning are more crucial to AAC than global information and temporal relationship learning.</p></details> | 2021-02-24 |  |
| **[Continual Learning for Automated Audio Captioning Using The Learning Without Forgetting Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08028v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated audio captioning (AAC) is the task of automatically creating textual descriptions (i.e. captions) for the contents of a general audio signal. Most AAC methods are using existing datasets to optimize and/or evaluate upon. Given the limited information held by the AAC datasets, it is very likely that AAC methods learn only the information contained in the utilized datasets. In this paper we present a first approach for continuously adapting an AAC method to new information, using a continual learning method. In our scenario, a pre-optimized AAC method is used for some unseen general audio signals and can update its parameters in order to adapt to the new information, given a new reference caption. We evaluate our method using a freely available, pre-optimized AAC method and two freely available AAC datasets. We compare our proposed method with three scenarios, two of training on one of the datasets and evaluating on the other and a third of training on one dataset and fine-tuning on the other. Obtained results show that our method achieves a good balance between distilling new knowledge and not forgetting the previous one.</p></details> | 2021-07-19 |  |

The current models are generally based on the neural encoder-decoder architecture, and their decoder mainly uses acoustic information that is extracted from the CNN-based encoder. However, they have ignored semantic information that could help the AAC model to generate meaningful descriptions. This paper proposes a novel approach for automated audio captioning based on incorporating semantic and acoustic information. Specifically, our audio captioning model consists of two sub-modules. (1) The pre-trained keyword encoder utilizes pre-trained ResNet38 to initialize its parameters, and then it is trained by extracted keywords as labels.

In recent years, AAC has quickly attracted research interest, with state-of-the-art systems now relying on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) backbone powered by strong models such as Transformers. Following the macro-trend of applied machine learning research, in this work, we strive to improve the performance of seq2seq AAC models by extensively leveraging pretrained models and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we utilize BEATs to extract fine-grained audio features. Then, we employ Instructor LLM to fetch text embeddings of captions, and infuse their language-modality knowledge into BEATs audio features via an auxiliary InfoNCE loss function. Moreover, we propose a novel data augmentation method that uses ChatGPT to produce caption mix-ups (i.e., grammatical and compact combinations of two captions) which, together with the corresponding audio mixtures, increase not only the amount but also the complexity and diversity of training data. During inference, we propose to employ nucleus sampling and a hybrid reranking algorithm, which has not been explored in AAC research. Combining our efforts, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art 32.6 SPIDEr-FL score on the Clotho evaluation split, and wins the 2023 DCASE AAC challenge.</p></details> | 2024-01-11 | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2024 camera-ready paper.

Our framework consists of two language models: a translation language model and a speech synthesis language model. We use discretized speech units, which are generated in a fully unsupervised way, and thus our framework can be used for unwritten languages. For the speech synthesis part, we adopt the existing VALL-E X approach and build a unit-based audio language model. This grants our framework the ability to preserve the voice characteristics and the speaking style of the original speech. We examine our system on Chinese $\rightarrow$ English and English $\rightarrow$ Spanish pairs. Experimental results show that our system can generate speech with high translation quality and audio quality.

Language models built upon the ground truth utterances of datasets learn grammar and structure rules of words and sentences (the latter in the case of continuous speech). However, visual co-articulation effects in visual speech signals damage the performance of visual speech LM's as visually, people do not utter what the language model expects. These models are commonplace but while higher-order N-gram LM's may improve classification rates, the cost of this model is disproportionate to the common goal of developing more accurate classifiers. So we compare which unit would best optimize a lipreading (visual speech) LM to observe their limitations. We compare three units; visemes (visual speech units) \cite{lan2010improving}, phonemes (audible speech units), and words.</p></details> | 2018-09-19 | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract based on Decoding Visemes: improving machine lipreading, Bear & Harvey, ICASSP 2016</p></details> |

However, existing speech tokens are not specifically designed for speech language modeling. To assess the suitability of speech tokens for building speech language models, we established the first benchmark, SLMTokBench. Our results indicate that neither semantic nor acoustic tokens are ideal for this purpose. Therefore, we propose SpeechTokenizer, a unified speech tokenizer for speech large language models. SpeechTokenizer adopts the Encoder-Decoder architecture with residual vector quantization (RVQ). Unifying semantic and acoustic tokens, SpeechTokenizer disentangles different aspects of speech information hierarchically across different RVQ layers. Furthermore, We construct a Unified Speech Language Model (USLM) leveraging SpeechTokenizer. Experiments show that SpeechTokenizer performs comparably to EnCodec in speech reconstruction and demonstrates strong performance on the SLMTokBench benchmark. Also, USLM outperforms VALL-E in zero-shot Text-to-Speech tasks.

We evaluate the efficiency of NAST considering several spoken language modeling tasks and show that NAST is superior to the evaluated baselines across all setups.

Early works synthesized speaker style aligned speech in order to directly learn the mapping from speech to target speech spectrogram. Without reliance on style aligned data, recent studies leverage the advances of language modeling (LM) and build cascaded LMs on semantic and acoustic tokens. This work proposes SeamlessExpressiveLM, a single speech language model for expressive S2ST. We decompose the complex source-to-target speech mapping into intermediate generation steps with chain-of-thought prompting. The model is first guided to translate target semantic content and then transfer the speaker style to multi-stream acoustic units. Evaluated on Spanish-to-English and Hungarian-to-English translations, SeamlessExpressiveLM outperforms cascaded LMs in both semantic quality and style transfer, meanwhile achieving better parameter efficiency.</p></details> | 2024-06-03 |  |
| **[LLaSM: Large Language and Speech Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15930v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models have garnered significant interest recently. Though, most of the works focus on vision-language multi-modal models providing strong capabilities in following vision-and-language instructions. However, we claim that speech is also an important modality through which humans interact with the world. Hence, it is crucial for a general-purpose assistant to be able to follow multi-modal speech-and-language instructions. In this work, we propose Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM). LLaSM is an end-to-end trained large multi-modal speech-language model with cross-modal conversational abilities, capable of following speech-and-language instructions. Our early experiments show that LLaSM demonstrates a more convenient and natural way for humans to interact with artificial intelligence.

| **[LAST: Language Model Aware Speech Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03701v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech tokenization serves as the foundation of speech language model (LM), enabling them to perform various tasks such as spoken language modeling, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, etc. Most speech tokenizers are trained independently of the LM training process, relying on separate acoustic models and quantization methods. Following such an approach may create a mismatch between the tokenization process and its usage afterward. In this study, we propose a novel approach to training a speech tokenizer by leveraging objectives from pre-trained textual LMs. We advocate for the integration of this objective into the process of learning discrete speech representations. Our aim is to transform features from a pre-trained speech model into a new feature space that enables better clustering for speech LMs. We empirically investigate the impact of various model design choices, including speech vocabulary size and text LM size. Our results demonstrate the proposed tokenization method outperforms the evaluated baselines considering both spoken language modeling and speech-to-text. More importantly, unlike prior work, the proposed method allows the utilization of a single pre-trained LM for processing both speech and text inputs, setting it apart from conventional tokenization approaches.</p></details> | 2024-09-11 |  |
| **[SpeechPrompt: Prompting Speech Language Models for Speech Processing Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13040v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a practical method for utilizing pre-trained language models (LMs). This approach offers several advantages. It allows an LM to adapt to new tasks with minimal training and parameter updates, thus achieving efficiency in both storage and computation. Additionally, prompting modifies only the LM's inputs and harnesses the generative capabilities of language models to address various downstream tasks in a unified manner. This significantly reduces the need for human labor in designing task-specific models. These advantages become even more evident as the number of tasks served by the LM scales up. Motivated by the strengths of prompting, we are the first to explore the potential of prompting speech LMs in the domain of speech processing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in converting speech into discrete units for language modeling. Our pioneer research demonstrates that these quantized speech units are highly versatile within our unified prompting framework. Not only can they serve as class labels, but they also contain rich phonetic information that can be re-synthesized back into speech signals for speech generation tasks. Specifically, we reformulate speech processing tasks into speech-to-unit generation tasks. As a result, we can seamlessly integrate tasks such as speech classification, sequence generation, and speech generation within a single, unified prompting framework. The experiment results show that the prompting method can achieve competitive performance compared to the strong fine-tuning method based on self-supervised learning models with a similar number of trainable parameters. The prompting method also shows promising results in the few-shot setting. Moreover, with the advanced speech LMs coming into the stage, the proposed prompting framework attains great potential.</p></details> | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing (TASLP)</p></details> |
| **[OpusLM: A Family of Open Unified Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17611v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Open Unified Speech Language Models (OpusLMs), a family of open foundational speech language models (SpeechLMs) up to 7B. Initialized from decoder-only text language models, the OpusLMs are continuously pre-trained on 213K hours of speech-text pairs and 292B text-only tokens. We demonstrate our OpusLMs achieve comparable (or even superior) performance with existing SpeechLMs in speech recognition, speech synthesis, and text-only capabilities. Technically, this paper articulates our SpeechLM designs on tokenization, multi-stream language models, and multi-stage training strategies. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of model size scaling and the effect of annealing data selection. The OpusLMs are all built from publicly available materials and are fully transparent models. We release our code, data, checkpoints, and training logs to facilitate open SpeechLM research</p></details> | 2025-06-25 |  |
| **[DeSTA: Enhancing Speech Language Models through Descriptive Speech-Text Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18871v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent speech language models (SLMs) typically incorporate pre-trained speech models to extend the capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose a Descriptive Speech-Text Alignment approach that leverages speech captioning to bridge the gap between speech and text modalities, enabling SLMs to interpret and generate comprehensive natural language descriptions, thereby facilitating the capability to understand both linguistic and non-linguistic features in speech. Enhanced with the proposed approach, our model demonstrates superior performance on the Dynamic-SUPERB benchmark, particularly in generalizing to unseen tasks. Moreover, we discover that the aligned model exhibits a zero-shot instruction-following capability without explicit speech instruction tuning. These findings highlight the potential to reshape instruction-following SLMs by incorporating rich, descriptive speech captions.</p></details> | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2024</p></details> |
| **[Language-Codec: Bridging Discrete Codec Representations and Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12208v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models have achieved significant success in generative tasks related to speech, audio, music, and other signal domains. A crucial element of these models is the discrete acoustic codecs, which serve as an intermediate representation replacing the mel-spectrogram. However, there exist several gaps between discrete codecs and downstream speech language models. Specifically, 1) Due to the reconstruction paradigm of the Codec model and the structure of residual vector quantization, the initial channel of the codebooks contains excessive information, making it challenging to directly generate acoustic tokens from weakly supervised signals such as text in downstream tasks. 2) numerous codebooks increases the burden on downstream speech language models. Consequently, leveraging the characteristics of speech language models, we propose Language-Codec. In the Language-Codec, we introduce a Masked Channel Residual Vector Quantization (MCRVQ) mechanism along with improved fourier transform structures and attention blocks, refined discriminator design to address the aforementioned gaps. We compare our method with competing audio compression algorithms and observe significant outperformance across extensive evaluations. Furthermore, we also validate the efficiency of the Language-Codec on downstream speech language models. The source code and pre-trained models can be accessed at https://github.com/jishengpeng/languagecodec .</p></details> | 2025-06-05 | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Toward Joint Language Modeling for Speech Units and Text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08715v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech and text are two major forms of human language. The research community has been focusing on mapping speech to text or vice versa for many years. However, in the field of language modeling, very little effort has been made to model them jointly. In light of this, we explore joint language modeling for speech units and text. Specifically, we compare different speech tokenizers to transform continuous speech signals into discrete units and use different methods to construct mixed speech-text data. We introduce automatic metrics to evaluate how well the joint LM mixes speech and text. We also fine-tune the LM on downstream spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks with different modalities (speech or text) and test its performance to assess the model's learning of shared representations. Our results show that by mixing speech units and text with our proposed mixing techniques, the joint LM improves over a speech-only baseline on SLU tasks and shows zero-shot cross-modal transferability.</p></details> | 2023-10-16 | EMNLP findings 2023 |
| **[SECap: Speech Emotion Captioning with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10381v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech emotions are crucial in human communication and are extensively used in fields like speech synthesis and natural language understanding. Most prior studies, such as speech emotion recognition, have categorized speech emotions into a fixed set of classes. Yet, emotions expressed in human speech are often complex, and categorizing them into predefined groups can be insufficient to adequately represent speech emotions. On the contrary, describing speech emotions directly by means of natural language may be a more effective approach. Regrettably, there are not many studies available that have focused on this direction. Therefore, this paper proposes a speech emotion captioning framework named SECap, aiming at effectively describing speech emotions using natural language. Owing to the impressive capabilities of large language models in language comprehension and text generation, SECap employs LLaMA as the text decoder to allow the production of coherent speech emotion captions. In addition, SECap leverages HuBERT as the audio encoder to extract general speech features and Q-Former as the Bridge-Net to provide LLaMA with emotion-related speech features. To accomplish this, Q-Former utilizes mutual information learning to disentangle emotion-related speech features and speech contents, while implementing contrastive learning to extract more emotion-related speech features. The results of objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that: 1) the SECap framework outperforms the HTSAT-BART baseline in all objective evaluations; 2) SECap can generate high-quality speech emotion captions that attain performance on par with human annotators in subjective mean opinion score tests.</p></details> | 2023-12-27 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2024</p></details> |

In order to extend this capability to a multi-modal setting (i.e. speech and language), this paper introduces the Seal model, an abbreviation for speech language model. It incorporates a novel alignment method, in which Kullback-Leibler divergence loss is performed to train a projector that bridges a frozen speech encoder with a frozen language model decoder. The resulting Seal model exhibits robust performance as a few-shot learner on two speech understanding tasks. Additionally, consistency experiments are conducted to validate its robustness on different pre-trained language models.</p></details> | 2024-07-23 |  |

However, there is still a lack of exploration on how to build speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs. To address this, we propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech instructions with extremely low latency. We build our model based on the latest Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. To align the model with speech interaction scenarios, we construct a dataset named InstructS2S-200K, which includes 200K speech instructions and corresponding speech responses. Experimental results show that compared to previous speech-language models, LLaMA-Omni provides better responses in both content and style, with a response latency as low as 226ms. Additionally, training LLaMA-Omni takes less than 3 days on just 4 GPUs, paving the way for the efficient development of speech-language models in the future.</p></details> | 2025-03-04 | ICLR 2025 |

While the details are unknown to the open research community, it likely involves significant amounts of curated data and compute, neither of which is readily accessible. In this paper, we present BLSP-Emo (Bootstrapped Language-Speech Pretraining with Emotion support), a novel approach to developing an end-to-end speech-language model capable of understanding both semantics and emotions in speech and generate empathetic responses. BLSP-Emo utilizes existing speech recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets through a two-stage process. The first stage focuses on semantic alignment, following recent work on pretraining speech-language models using ASR data. The second stage performs emotion alignment with the pretrained speech-language model on an emotion-aware continuation task constructed from SER data. Our experiments demonstrate that the BLSP-Emo model excels in comprehending speech and delivering empathetic responses, both in instruction-following tasks and conversations.</p></details> | 2024-06-07 |  |
| **[Scaling Properties of Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00685v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn language from raw audio, without textual resources. Despite significant advances, our current models exhibit weak syntax and semantic abilities. However, if the scaling properties of neural language models hold for the speech modality, these abilities will improve as the amount of compute used for training increases. In this paper, we use models of this scaling behavior to estimate the scale at which our current methods will yield a SLM with the English proficiency of text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). We establish a strong correlation between pre-training loss and downstream syntactic and semantic performance in SLMs and LLMs, which results in predictable scaling of linguistic performance. We show that the linguistic performance of SLMs scales up to three orders of magnitude more slowly than that of text-based LLMs. Additionally, we study the benefits of synthetic data designed to boost semantic understanding and the effects of coarser speech tokenization.</p></details> | 2024-12-13 |  |
| **[Leveraging Unit Language Guidance to Advance Speech Modeling in Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15333v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of building textless speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models has attracted much attention. However, S2ST still faces two main challenges: 1) extracting linguistic features for various speech signals, called cross-modal (CM), and 2) learning alignment of difference languages in long sequences, called cross-lingual (CL). We propose the unit language to overcome the two modeling challenges. The unit language can be considered a text-like representation format, constructed using $n$-gram language modeling. We implement multi-task learning to utilize the unit language in guiding the speech modeling process. Our initial results reveal a conflict when applying source and target unit languages simultaneously. We propose task prompt modeling to mitigate this conflict. We conduct experiments on four languages of the Voxpupil dataset. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over a strong baseline and achieves performance comparable to models trained with text.</p></details> | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[TaDiCodec: Text-aware Diffusion Speech Tokenizer for Speech Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16790v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech tokenizers serve as foundational components for speech language models, yet current designs exhibit several limitations, including: 1) dependence on multi-layer residual vector quantization structures or high frame rates, 2) reliance on auxiliary pre-trained models for semantic distillation, and 3) requirements for complex two-stage training processes. In this work, we introduce the Text-aware Diffusion Transformer Speech Codec (TaDiCodec), a novel approach designed to overcome these challenges. TaDiCodec employs end-to-end optimization for quantization and reconstruction through a diffusion autoencoder, while integrating text guidance into the diffusion decoder to enhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression. TaDiCodec achieves an extremely low frame rate of 6.25 Hz and a corresponding bitrate of 0.0875 kbps with a single-layer codebook for 24 kHz speech, while maintaining superior performance on critical speech generation evaluation metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity (SIM), and speech quality (UTMOS). Notably, TaDiCodec employs a single-stage, end-to-end training paradigm, and obviating the need for auxiliary pre-trained models. We also validate the compatibility of TaDiCodec in language model based zero-shot text-to-speech with both autoregressive modeling and masked generative modeling, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling, as well as a significantly small reconstruction-generation gap. We will open source our code and model checkpoints. Audio samples are are available at https:/tadicodec.github.io/. We release code and model checkpoints at https:/github.com/HeCheng0625/Diffusion-Speech-Tokenizer.</p></details> | 2025-08-26 |  |
| **[Exploring the Effect of Segmentation and Vocabulary Size on Speech Tokenization for Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17446v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The purpose of speech tokenization is to transform a speech signal into a sequence of discrete representations, serving as the foundation for speech language models (SLMs). While speech tokenization has many options, their effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.</p></details> | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech2025</p></details> |

We first emphasize the importance of collecting large-scale, spontaneous, high-quality unsupervised speech data, and show that continued pretraining HuBERT on this dataset outperforms both the base model and African-centric models on ASR. We then integrate this speech encoder into a Wolof LLM to train the first Speech LLM for this language, extending its capabilities to tasks such as speech translation. Furthermore, we explore training the Speech LLM to perform multi-step Chain-of-Thought before transcribing or translating. Our results show that the Speech LLM not only improves speech recognition but also performs well in speech translation. The models and the code will be openly shared.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 |  |

Inspired by the recent trend towards the deployment of large language models (LLMs) as universal learners and processors of non-lexical inputs, such as audio and video, we approach the task of multi-label dysfluency detection as a language modeling problem. We present hypotheses candidates generated with an automatic speech recognition system and acoustic representations extracted from an audio encoder model to an LLM, and finetune the system to predict dysfluency labels on three datasets containing English and German stuttered speech. The experimental results show that our system effectively combines acoustic and lexical information and achieves competitive results on the multi-label stuttering detection task.</p></details> | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2024</p></details> |

One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets, covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.</p></details> | 2025-10-02 |  |
| **[SECodec: Structural Entropy-based Compressive Speech Representation Codec for Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00018v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech representations have become crucial for integrating speech into LLMs. Existing methods for speech representation discretization rely on a predefined codebook size and Euclidean distance-based quantization. However, 1) the size of codebook is a critical parameter that affects both codec performance and downstream task training efficiency. 2) The Euclidean distance-based quantization may lead to audio distortion when the size of the codebook is controlled within a reasonable range. In fact, in the field of information compression, structural information and entropy guidance are crucial, but previous methods have largely overlooked these factors. Therefore, we address the above issues from an information-theoretic perspective, we present SECodec, a novel speech representation codec based on structural entropy (SE) for building speech language models. Specifically, we first model speech as a graph, clustering the speech features nodes within the graph and extracting the corresponding codebook by hierarchically and disentangledly minimizing 2D SE. Then, to address the issue of audio distortion, we propose a new quantization method. This method still adheres to the 2D SE minimization principle, adaptively selecting the most suitable token corresponding to the cluster for each incoming original speech node. Furthermore, we develop a Structural Entropy-based Speech Language Model (SESLM) that leverages SECodec. Experimental results demonstrate that SECodec performs comparably to EnCodec in speech reconstruction, and SESLM surpasses VALL-E in zero-shot text-to-speech tasks.

Rather than encode history beyond the current sentence using a cache of words or document-level features, we focus our study on the ability of LSTM and Transformer language models to implicitly learn to carry over context across sentence boundaries. We introduce a new architecture that incorporates an attention mechanism into LSTM to combine the benefits of recurrent and attention architectures. We conduct language modeling and speech recognition experiments on the publicly available LibriSpeech corpus. We show that conventional training on a paragraph-level corpus results in significant reductions in perplexity compared to training on a sentence-level corpus. We also describe speech recognition experiments using long-span language models in second-pass re-ranking, and provide insights into the ability of such models to take advantage of context beyond the current sentence.</p></details> | 2019-11-13 |  |

The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.</p></details> | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our company need to do internal review</p></details> |

This requires significant annotation efforts and risks catastrophic forgetting of the original language capabilities. In this work, we present a simple yet effective automatic process for creating speech-text pair data that carefully injects speech paralinguistic understanding abilities into SLMs while preserving the inherent language capabilities of the text-based LLM. Our model demonstrates general capabilities for speech-related tasks without the need for speech instruction-tuning data, achieving impressive performance on Dynamic-SUPERB and AIR-Bench-Chat benchmarks. Furthermore, our model exhibits the ability to follow complex instructions derived from LLMs, such as specific output formatting and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach not only enhances the versatility and effectiveness of SLMs but also reduces reliance on extensive annotated datasets, paving the way for more efficient and capable speech understanding systems.</p></details> | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Speech language models lack important brain-relevant semantics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04664v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite known differences between reading and listening in the brain, recent work has shown that text-based language models predict both text-evoked and speech-evoked brain activity to an impressive degree. This poses the question of what types of information language models truly predict in the brain. We investigate this question via a direct approach, in which we systematically remove specific low-level stimulus features (textual, speech, and visual) from language model representations to assess their impact on alignment with fMRI brain recordings during reading and listening. Comparing these findings with speech-based language models reveals starkly different effects of low-level features on brain alignment. While text-based models show reduced alignment in early sensory regions post-removal, they retain significant predictive power in late language regions. In contrast, speech-based models maintain strong alignment in early auditory regions even after feature removal but lose all predictive power in late language regions. These results suggest that speech-based models provide insights into additional information processed by early auditory regions, but caution is needed when using them to model processing in late language regions. We make our code publicly available.

We leverage pre-trained embeddings from deep learning models trained on linguistic and acoustic data to represent high-level speech features and map them onto these high-gamma signals. We analyze the extent to which these embeddings preserve the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. Reconstructed neural signals are evaluated against high-gamma ground-truth activity using correlation metrics and signal reconstruction quality assessments. The results indicate that high-gamma activity can be effectively reconstructed using large language and speech model embeddings in all study participants, generating Pearson's correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.99.</p></details> | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at Interspeech2025</p></details> |

This study is the first work exploring ICL for speech classification tasks with textless speech LM. We first show that the current speech LM lacks the ICL capability.

However, natural human interaction often relies on speech, necessitating a shift towards voice-based models. A straightforward approach to achieve this involves a pipeline of ``Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) + LLM + Text-to-Speech (TTS)", where input speech is transcribed to text, processed by an LLM, and then converted back to speech. Despite being straightforward, this method suffers from inherent limitations, such as information loss during modality conversion, significant latency due to the complex pipeline, and error accumulation across the three stages. To address these issues, Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) -- end-to-end models that generate speech without converting from text -- have emerged as a promising alternative. This survey paper provides the first comprehensive overview of recent methodologies for constructing SpeechLMs, detailing the key components of their architecture and the various training recipes integral to their development.

| **[Advancing Speech Understanding in Speech-Aware Language Models with GRPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16990v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based method for training Speech-Aware Large Language Models (SALLMs) on open-format speech understanding tasks, such as Spoken Question Answering and Automatic Speech Translation. SALLMs have proven highly effective for speech understanding tasks. GRPO has recently gained traction for its efficiency in training LLMs, and prior work has explored its application to SALLMs, primarily in multiple-choice tasks. Building on this, we focus on open-format tasks that better reflect the generative abilities of the models. Our approach leverages GRPO with BLEU as the reward signal to optimize SALLMs, and we demonstrate empirically that it surpasses standard SFT across several key metrics. Finally, we explore the potential of incorporating off-policy samples within GRPO for these tasks, highlighting avenues for further improvement and further research.</p></details> | 2025-09-23 |  |

However, effective cross-cultural communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional pipelines.</p></details> | 2025-05-09 |  |
| **[SpeechLMScore: Evaluating speech generation using speech language model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04559v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While human evaluation is the most reliable metric for evaluating speech generation systems, it is generally costly and time-consuming. Previous studies on automatic speech quality assessment address the problem by predicting human evaluation scores with machine learning models. However, they rely on supervised learning and thus suffer from high annotation costs and domain-shift problems. We propose SpeechLMScore, an unsupervised metric to evaluate generated speech using a speech-language model. SpeechLMScore computes the average log-probability of a speech signal by mapping it into discrete tokens and measures the average probability of generating the sequence of tokens. Therefore, it does not require human annotation and is a highly scalable framework. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed metric shows a promising correlation with human evaluation scores on different speech generation tasks including voice conversion, text-to-speech, and speech enhancement.</p></details> | 2022-12-12 |  |

Recent SLMs integrate speech perception with large language models (LLMs), often degrading textual capabilities due to speech-centric training. Existing benchmarks conflate speech perception with instruction-following, hindering evaluation of these distinct skills. To address this gap, we provide a benchmark for diagnosing the instruction-following abilities of SLMs. Our findings show that most SLMs struggle with even basic instructions, performing far worse than text-based LLMs. Additionally, these models are highly sensitive to prompt variations, often yielding inconsistent and unreliable outputs. We highlight core challenges and provide insights to guide future research, emphasizing the need for evaluation beyond task-level metrics.</p></details> | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Accec...</summary><p>Accecpted by Interspeech 2025; https://github.com/kehanlu/Speech-IFEval</p></details> |

Humans can leverage semantic information, such as familiar linguistic patterns and contextual cues, to reconstruct incomplete or masked speech signals in noisy environments. However, existing speech enhancement (SE) approaches often overlook the rich semantic information embedded in speech, which is crucial for improving intelligibility, speaker consistency, and overall quality of enhanced speech signals. To enrich the SE model with semantic information, we employ language models as an efficient semantic learner and propose a comprehensive framework tailored for language model-based speech enhancement, called \textit{GenSE}. Specifically, we approach SE as a conditional language modeling task rather than a continuous signal regression problem defined in existing works. This is achieved by tokenizing speech signals into semantic tokens using a pre-trained self-supervised model and into acoustic tokens using a custom-designed single-quantizer neural codec model. To improve the stability of language model predictions, we propose a hierarchical modeling method that decouples the generation of clean semantic tokens and clean acoustic tokens into two distinct stages. Moreover, we introduce a token chain prompting mechanism during the acoustic token generation stage to ensure timbre consistency throughout the speech enhancement process. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art SE systems in terms of speech quality and generalization capability.</p></details> | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Spoken Language Models with Syllabic Speech Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26634v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling, evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a 2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient long-context spoken language models.</p></details> | 2025-10-01 |  |

Recent large audio-language models (LALMs) demonstrate strong cross-modal audio understanding; however, their behavior in disfluent child speech remains underexplored. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs in two settings: an interview (mixed speakers) and a reading task (single child). The tasks are (i) single-channel source separation to isolate the child and (ii) child-only summarization that preserves clinically relevant disfluencies and avoids adult-speech leakage. Evaluation combines Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge, human expert ratings, and BERTScore (F1), and we report agreement between models and between models and humans to assess reliability. Our findings delineate the conditions under which LALMs produce faithful child-only summaries from mixed audio and where they fail, offering practical guidance for clinical and educational deployments. We provide prompts and evaluation scripts to support replication.</p></details> | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 Figure, 8 tables, Under review ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Decoding Hate: Exploring Language Models' Reactions to Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00775v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hate speech is a harmful form of online expression, often manifesting as derogatory posts. It is a significant risk in digital environments. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is concern about their potential to replicate hate speech patterns, given their training on vast amounts of unmoderated internet data. Understanding how LLMs respond to hate speech is crucial for their responsible deployment. However, the behaviour of LLMs towards hate speech has been limited compared. This paper investigates the reactions of seven state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA 2, Vicuna, LLaMA 3, Mistral, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Gemini Pro) to hate speech. Through qualitative analysis, we aim to reveal the spectrum of responses these models produce, highlighting their capacity to handle hate speech inputs. We also discuss strategies to mitigate hate speech generation by LLMs, particularly through fine-tuning and guideline guardrailing. Finally, we explore the models' responses to hate speech framed in politically correct language.</p></details> | 2025-06-10 |  |
| **[FastLongSpeech: Enhancing Large Speech-Language Models for Efficient Long-Speech Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14815v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[SLAM: A Unified Encoder for Speech and Language Modeling via Speech-Text Joint Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10329v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised pre-training is now the predominant approach for both text and speech understanding. Self-attention models pre-trained on large amounts of unannotated data have been hugely successful when fine-tuned on downstream tasks from a variety of domains and languages. This paper takes the universality of unsupervised language pre-training one step further, by unifying speech and text pre-training within a single model. We build a single encoder with the BERT objective on unlabeled text together with the w2v-BERT objective on unlabeled speech. To further align our model representations across modalities, we leverage alignment losses, specifically Translation Language Modeling (TLM) and Speech Text Matching (STM) that make use of supervised speech-text recognition data. We demonstrate that incorporating both speech and text data during pre-training can significantly improve downstream quality on CoVoST~2 speech translation, by around 1 BLEU compared to single-modality pre-trained models, while retaining close to SotA performance on LibriSpeech and SpeechStew ASR tasks. On four GLUE tasks and text-normalization, we observe evidence of capacity limitations and interference between the two modalities, leading to degraded performance compared to an equivalent text-only model, while still being competitive with BERT. Through extensive empirical analysis we also demonstrate the importance of the choice of objective function for speech pre-training, and the beneficial effect of adding additional supervised signals on the quality of the learned representations.</p></details> | 2021-10-22 |  |
| **[Proceedings of the ISCA/ITG Workshop on Diversity in Large Speech and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10298v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning techniques have conquered many different tasks in speech and natural language processing, such as speech recognition, information extraction, text and speech generation, and human machine interaction using natural language or speech (chatbots). Modern techniques typically rely on large models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages (Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio characteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech and language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with such technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by how far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been trained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the language used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to some gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and users who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies. On top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs, under-represented languages and dialects/sociolects may decrease in terms of priorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is not available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language technology usage. The workshop sets out to discuss this problem based on scientific contributions from the perspective of computer science and linguistics (including computational linguistics and NLP).</p></details> | 2025-03-18 |  |

In this work, we propose TWIST, a method for training SpeechLMs using a warm-start from a pretrained textual language models.

We empirically analyze the effect of different model design choices such as the speech tokenizer, the pretrained textual model, and the dataset size. We find that model and dataset scale both play an important role in constructing better-performing SpeechLMs. Based on our observations, we present the largest (to the best of our knowledge) SpeechLM both in terms of number of parameters and training data. We additionally introduce two spoken versions of the StoryCloze textual benchmark to further improve model evaluation and advance future research in the field.

E2E approaches utilizing pre-trained models are gaining attention for conserving training data and resources. However, most of their applications in ASR involve only one of either a pre-trained speech or a language model. This paper proposes integrating a pre-trained speech representation model and a large language model (LLM) for E2E ASR. The proposed model enables the optimization of the entire ASR process, including acoustic feature extraction and acoustic and language modeling, by combining pre-trained models with a bridge network and also enables the application of remarkable developments in LLM utilization, such as parameter-efficient domain adaptation and inference optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a performance comparable to that of modern E2E ASR models by utilizing powerful pre-training models with the proposed integrated approach.</p></details> | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables, accepted for Findings of ACL 2024.

| **[Energy-Based Models with Applications to Speech and Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10961v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy-Based Models (EBMs) are an important class of probabilistic models, also known as random fields and undirected graphical models. EBMs are un-normalized and thus radically different from other popular self-normalized probabilistic models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), autoregressive models, generative adversarial nets (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs). Over the past years, EBMs have attracted increasing interest not only from the core machine learning community, but also from application domains such as speech, vision, natural language processing (NLP) and so on, due to significant theoretical and algorithmic progress. The sequential nature of speech and language also presents special challenges and needs a different treatment from processing fix-dimensional data (e.g., images). Therefore, the purpose of this monograph is to present a systematic introduction to energy-based models, including both algorithmic progress and applications in speech and language processing. First, the basics of EBMs are introduced, including classic models, recent models parameterized by neural networks, sampling methods, and various learning methods from the classic learning algorithms to the most advanced ones. Then, the application of EBMs in three different scenarios is presented, i.e., for modeling marginal, conditional and joint distributions, respectively. 1) EBMs for sequential data with applications in language modeling, where the main focus is on the marginal distribution of a sequence itself; 2) EBMs for modeling conditional distributions of target sequences given observation sequences, with applications in speech recognition, sequence labeling and text generation; 3) EBMs for modeling joint distributions of both sequences of observations and targets, and their applications in semi-supervised learning and calibrated natural language understanding.</p></details> | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>The v...</summary><p>The version before publisher editing</p></details> |

However, they suffer from robustness issues due to the accumulation of errors in speech unit predictions during autoregressive language modeling. In this paper, we propose a phonetic enhanced language modeling method to improve the performance of TTS models. We leverage self-supervised representations that are phonetically rich as the training target for the autoregressive language model. Subsequently, a non-autoregressive model is employed to predict discrete acoustic codecs that contain fine-grained acoustic details. The TTS model focuses solely on linguistic modeling during autoregressive training, thereby reducing the error propagation that occurs in non-autoregressive training. Both objective and subjective evaluations validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Language Modelling in the Speech Domain Using Sub-word Linguistic Units](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00610v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) for text data have been studied extensively for their usefulness in language generation and other downstream tasks. However, language modelling purely in the speech domain is still a relatively unexplored topic, with traditional speech LMs often depending on auxiliary text LMs for learning distributional aspects of the language. For the English language, these LMs treat words as atomic units, which presents inherent challenges to language modelling in the speech domain. In this paper, we propose a novel LSTM-based generative speech LM that is inspired by the CBOW model and built on linguistic units including syllables and phonemes. This offers better acoustic consistency across utterances in the dataset, as opposed to single melspectrogram frames, or whole words. With a limited dataset, orders of magnitude smaller than that required by contemporary generative models, our model closely approximates babbling speech. We show the effect of training with auxiliary text LMs, multitask learning objectives, and auxiliary articulatory features. Through our experiments, we also highlight some well known, but poorly documented challenges in training generative speech LMs, including the mismatch between the supervised learning objective with which these models are trained such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the true objective, which is speech quality. Our experiments provide an early indication that while validation loss and Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD) are not strongly correlated with generated speech quality, traditional text language modelling metrics like perplexity and next-token-prediction accuracy might be.</p></details> | 2021-11-02 |  |

However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.</p></details> | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is at https://github.com/ictnlp/StreamUni; The model is at https://huggingface.co/ICTNLP/StreamUni-Phi4</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{S}peech \textbf{T}ransformer (GPST), a hierarchical transformer designed for efficient speech language modeling. GPST quantizes audio waveforms into two distinct types of discrete speech representations and integrates them within a hierarchical transformer architecture, allowing for a unified one-stage generation process and enhancing Hi-Res audio generation capabilities. By training on large corpora of speeches in an end-to-end unsupervised manner, GPST can generate syntactically consistent speech with diverse speaker identities. Given a brief 3-second prompt, GPST can produce natural and coherent personalized speech, demonstrating in-context learning abilities. Moreover, our approach can be easily extended to spoken cross-lingual speech generation by incorporating multi-lingual semantic tokens and universal acoustic tokens. Experimental results indicate that GPST significantly outperforms the existing speech language models in terms of word error rate, speech quality, and speaker similarity.

Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.</p></details> | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Among such tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining the published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the architectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only organize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation approaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each architectural building block and training choice.

Yet obtaining even a small amount of such data can be problematic, especially for sensitive domains and conversational speech scenarios, due to both privacy issues and annotation costs. To address this, synthetic data generation using single speaker datasets has been employed. Yet, for multi-speaker cases, such an approach often requires extensive manual effort and is prone to domain mismatches. In this work, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for multi-speaker conversational ASR, leveraging a large language model (LLM) for content creation and a conversational multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) model for speech synthesis. We conduct evaluation by fine-tuning the Whisper ASR model for telephone and distant conversational speech settings, using both in-domain data and generated synthetic data. Our results show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform classical multi-speaker generation approaches that use external, non-conversational speech datasets.</p></details> | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SynData4GenAI 2024 workshop</p></details> |

However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time. From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time.

| **[Language-agnostic, automated assessment of listeners' speech recall using large language models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01045v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech-comprehension difficulties are common among older people. Standard speech tests do not fully capture such difficulties because the tests poorly resemble the context-rich, story-like nature of ongoing conversation and are typically available only in a country's dominant/official language (e.g., English), leading to inaccurate scores for native speakers of other languages. Assessments for naturalistic, story speech in multiple languages require accurate, time-efficient scoring. The current research leverages modern large language models (LLMs) in native English speakers and native speakers of 10 other languages to automate the generation of high-quality, spoken stories and scoring of speech recall in different languages. Participants listened to and freely recalled short stories (in quiet/clear and in babble noise) in their native language. LLM text-embeddings and LLM prompt engineering with semantic similarity analyses to score speech recall revealed sensitivity to known effects of temporal order, primacy/recency, and background noise, and high similarity of recall scores across languages. The work overcomes limitations associated with simple speech materials and testing of closed native-speaker groups because recall data of varying length and details can be mapped across languages with high accuracy. The full automation of speech generation and recall scoring provides an important step towards comprehension assessments of naturalistic speech with clinical applicability.</p></details> | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 5 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Towards Building Speech Large Language Models for Multitask Understanding in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14804v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech large language models (SLLMs) built on speech encoders, adapters, and LLMs demonstrate remarkable multitask understanding performance in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. However, their effectiveness substantially degrades in low-resource languages such as Thai. This limitation arises from three factors: (1) existing commonly used speech encoders, like the Whisper family, underperform in low-resource languages and lack support for broader spoken language understanding tasks; (2) the ASR-based alignment paradigm requires training the entire SLLM, leading to high computational cost; (3) paired speech-text data in low-resource languages is scarce. To overcome these challenges in the low-resource language Thai, we introduce XLSR-Thai, the first self-supervised learning (SSL) speech encoder for Thai. It is obtained by continuously training the standard SSL XLSR model on 36,000 hours of Thai speech data. Furthermore, we propose U-Align, a speech-text alignment method that is more resource-efficient and multitask-effective than typical ASR-based alignment. Finally, we present Thai-SUP, a pipeline for generating Thai spoken language understanding data from high-resource languages, yielding the first Thai spoken language understanding dataset of over 1,000 hours. Multiple experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in building a Thai multitask-understanding SLLM. We open-source XLSR-Thai and Thai-SUP to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 2025-09-19 |  |
| **[An Investigation of Large Language Models for Real-World Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03346v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hate speech has emerged as a major problem plaguing our social spaces today. While there have been significant efforts to address this problem, existing methods are still significantly limited in effectively detecting hate speech online. A major limitation of existing methods is that hate speech detection is a highly contextual problem, and these methods cannot fully capture the context of hate speech to make accurate predictions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in several natural language tasks. LLMs have undergone extensive training using vast amounts of natural language data, enabling them to grasp intricate contextual details. Hence, they could be used as knowledge bases for context-aware hate speech detection. However, a fundamental problem with using LLMs to detect hate speech is that there are no studies on effectively prompting LLMs for context-aware hate speech detection. In this study, we conduct a large-scale study of hate speech detection, employing five established hate speech datasets. We discover that LLMs not only match but often surpass the performance of current benchmark machine learning models in identifying hate speech. By proposing four diverse prompting strategies that optimize the use of LLMs in detecting hate speech. Our study reveals that a meticulously crafted reasoning prompt can effectively capture the context of hate speech by fully utilizing the knowledge base in LLMs, significantly outperforming existing techniques. Furthermore, although LLMs can provide a rich knowledge base for the contextual detection of hate speech, suitable prompting strategies play a crucial role in effectively leveraging this knowledge base for efficient detection.</p></details> | 2024-01-09 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication on 22nd International Conference of Machine Learning and Applications, ICMLA 2023</p></details> |

However, the seamless integration of speech signals into LLMs has not been explored well. The "decoder-only" architecture has also not been well studied for speech processing tasks. In this research, we introduce Speech-LLaMA, a novel approach that effectively incorporates acoustic information into text-based large language models. Our method leverages Connectionist Temporal Classification and a simple audio encoder to map the compressed acoustic features to the continuous semantic space of the LLM. In addition, we further probe the decoder-only architecture for speech-to-text tasks by training a smaller scale randomly initialized speech-LLaMA model from speech-text paired data alone. We conduct experiments on multilingual speech-to-text translation tasks and demonstrate a significant improvement over strong baselines, highlighting the potential advantages of decoder-only models for speech-to-text conversion.</p></details> | 2023-10-03 |  |

We demonstrate the effectiveness of VGS models in few-shot learning scenarios for low-resource languages like Yoruba. Additionally, we examine the mutual exclusivity bias in VGS models.

However, it remains an open question whether findings and methods from text-based cross-lingual alignment apply to speech. Building on prior work on spoken translation retrieval, we perform pronunciation-controlled experiments to observe if cross-lingual alignment can indeed occur in such models on a semantic basis, instead of relying on phonetic similarities. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of phonetic cues, spoken translation retrieval accuracy remains relatively stable. We follow up with a controlled experiment on a word-level dataset of cross-lingual synonyms and near-homophones, confirming the existence of both phonetic and semantic knowledge in the encoder. Finally, we qualitatively examine the transcriptions produced by early exiting the encoder, where we observe that speech translation produces semantic errors that are characterized by phonetic similarities to corresponding words in the source language. We apply this insight from early exiting to speech recognition in seven low-resource languages unsupported by the Whisper model, and achieve improved accuracy in all languages examined, particularly for languages with transparent orthographies.</p></details> | 2025-05-27 |  |

| **[DualSpeechLM: Towards Unified Speech Understanding and Generation via Dual Speech Token Modeling with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08961v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)'s speech understanding or generation abilities by introducing various effective speech tokens has attracted great attention in the speech community. However, building a unified speech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges: (1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens, extending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data for fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information at different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features, while understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to difficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization and speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an Understanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level semantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text LLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which reduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech LLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that concurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a unified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision loss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and enhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between understanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of mutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.</p></details> | 2025-08-14 |  |
| **[LanSER: Language-Model Supported Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03978v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech emotion recognition (SER) models typically rely on costly human-labeled data for training, making scaling methods to large speech datasets and nuanced emotion taxonomies difficult. We present LanSER, a method that enables the use of unlabeled data by inferring weak emotion labels via pre-trained large language models through weakly-supervised learning. For inferring weak labels constrained to a taxonomy, we use a textual entailment approach that selects an emotion label with the highest entailment score for a speech transcript extracted via automatic speech recognition. Our experimental results show that models pre-trained on large datasets with this weak supervision outperform other baseline models on standard SER datasets when fine-tuned, and show improved label efficiency. Despite being pre-trained on labels derived only from text, we show that the resulting representations appear to model the prosodic content of speech.</p></details> | 2023-09-11 | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at INTERSPEECH 2023</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we systematically examine how different fine-tuning schemes including text-only, direct mixing, and curriculum learning affect spoken language understanding (SLU), focusing on scenarios where text-label pairs are abundant while paired speech-label data are limited. Results show that LALMs already achieve competitive performance with text-only fine-tuning, highlighting their strong generalization ability. Adding even small amounts of speech data (2-5%) yields substantial further gains, with curriculum learning particularly effective under scarce data. In cross-lingual SLU, combining source-language speech data with target-language text and minimal target-language speech data enables effective adaptation. Overall, this study provides practical insights into the LALM fine-tuning under realistic data constraints.</p></details> | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages (excluding references), 2 figures, submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Neural Codec Language Models are Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.02111v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a language modeling approach for text to speech synthesis (TTS). Specifically, we train a neural codec language model (called Vall-E) using discrete codes derived from an off-the-shelf neural audio codec model, and regard TTS as a conditional language modeling task rather than continuous signal regression as in previous work. During the pre-training stage, we scale up the TTS training data to 60K hours of English speech which is hundreds of times larger than existing systems. Vall-E emerges in-context learning capabilities and can be used to synthesize high-quality personalized speech with only a 3-second enrolled recording of an unseen speaker as an acoustic prompt. Experiment results show that Vall-E significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS system in terms of speech naturalness and speaker similarity. In addition, we find Vall-E could preserve the speaker's emotion and acoustic environment of the acoustic prompt in synthesis.

| **[ProsodyLM: Uncovering the Emerging Prosody Processing Capabilities in Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20091v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long contexts.</p></details> | 2025-08-11 |  |
| **[WavLLM: Towards Robust and Adaptive Speech Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00656v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, progressively broadening their scope to multimodal perception and generation. However, effectively integrating listening capabilities into LLMs poses significant challenges, particularly with respect to generalizing across varied contexts and executing complex auditory tasks. In this work, we introduce WavLLM, a robust and adaptive speech large language model with dual encoders, and a prompt-aware LoRA weight adapter, optimized by a two-stage curriculum learning approach. Leveraging dual encoders, we decouple different types of speech information, utilizing a Whisper encoder to process the semantic content of speech, and a WavLM encoder to capture the unique characteristics of the speaker's identity. Within the curriculum learning framework, WavLLM first builds its foundational capabilities by optimizing on mixed elementary single tasks, followed by advanced multi-task training on more complex tasks such as combinations of the elementary tasks. To enhance the flexibility and adherence to different tasks and instructions, a prompt-aware LoRA weight adapter is introduced in the second advanced multi-task training stage. We validate the proposed model on universal speech benchmarks including tasks such as ASR, ST, SV, ER, and also apply it to specialized datasets like Gaokao English listening comprehension set for SQA, and speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation set. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of speech tasks on the same model size, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities in executing complex tasks using CoT approach. Furthermore, our model successfully completes Gaokao tasks without specialized training. The codes, models, audio, and Gaokao evaluation set can be accessed at \url{aka.ms/wavllm}.</p></details> | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by EMNLP2024 findings</p></details> |

Joint speech-text modeling is a promising direction to achieve this. However, the effectiveness of recent speech tokens for joint modeling remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE), a method that directly addresses the modality gap by aligning speech token with the corresponding text transcription during the tokenization stage. We propose a method that can achieve this through a attention-based aggregation mechanism and with speech reconstruction as the training objective. We conduct extensive experiments and show that TASTE can preserve essential paralinguistic information while dramatically reducing the token sequence length. With TASTE, we perform straightforward joint spoken language modeling by using Low-Rank Adaptation on the pre-trained text LLM. Experimental results show that TASTE-based SLMs perform comparable to previous work on SALMON and StoryCloze; while significantly outperform other pre-trained SLMs on speech continuation across subjective and objective evaluations. To our knowledge, TASTE is the first end-to-end approach that utilizes a reconstruction objective to automatically learn a text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding suitable for spoken language modeling.

By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode.

However, while PLMs have been extensively researched for natural language understanding (NLU), their impact on TTS has been overlooked. In this study, we aim to address this gap by conducting a comparative analysis of different PLMs for two TTS tasks: prosody prediction and pause prediction. Firstly, we trained a prosody prediction model using 15 different PLMs. Our findings revealed a logarithmic relationship between model size and quality, as well as significant performance differences between neutral and expressive prosody. Secondly, we employed PLMs for pause prediction and found that the task was less sensitive to small models. We also identified a strong correlation between our empirical results and the GLUE scores obtained for these language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to investigate the impact of different PLMs on TTS.</p></details> | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 12th ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop (SSW) in Grenoble, France, from 26th to 28th August 2023</p></details> |

This paper introduces SpeechX, a versatile speech generation model capable of zero-shot TTS and various speech transformation tasks, dealing with both clean and noisy signals. SpeechX combines neural codec language modeling with multi-task learning using task-dependent prompting, enabling unified and extensible modeling and providing a consistent way for leveraging textual input in speech enhancement and transformation tasks.

Our approach initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model weights are available for exploration.</p></details> | 2025-10-01 |  |

Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples, a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.</p></details> | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026.

In this paper, we propose VioLA, a single auto-regressive Transformer decoder-only network that unifies various cross-modal tasks involving speech and text, such as speech-to-text, text-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech tasks, as a conditional codec language model task via multi-task learning framework. To accomplish this, we first convert all the speech utterances to discrete tokens (similar to the textual data) using an offline neural codec encoder. In such a way, all these tasks are converted to token-based sequence conversion problems, which can be naturally handled with one conditional language model. We further integrate task IDs (TID) and language IDs (LID) into the proposed model to enhance the modeling capability of handling different languages and tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VioLA model can support both single-modal and cross-modal tasks well, and the decoder-only model achieves a comparable and even better performance than the strong baselines.</p></details> | 2023-05-26 | Working in progress |

Nevertheless, most of the previous work focuses on prompting LLMs with perception abilities like auditory comprehension, and the effective approach for augmenting LLMs with speech synthesis capabilities remains ambiguous. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical exploration of boosting LLMs with the ability to generate speech, by combining pre-trained LLM LLaMA/OPT and text-to-speech synthesis model VALL-E. We compare three integration methods between LLMs and speech synthesis models, including directly fine-tuned LLMs, superposed layers of LLMs and VALL-E, and coupled LLMs and VALL-E using LLMs as a powerful text encoder. Experimental results show that, using LoRA method to fine-tune LLMs directly to boost the speech synthesis capability does not work well, and superposed LLMs and VALL-E can improve the quality of generated speech both in speaker similarity and word error rate (WER). Among these three methods, coupled methods leveraging LLMs as the text encoder can achieve the best performance, making it outperform original speech synthesis models with a consistently better speaker similarity and a significant (10.9%) WER reduction.</p></details> | 2024-01-02 |  |

However, there is no systematic understanding on how the codec system affects the speech generation performance of the SLM. In this work, we examine codec tokens within SLM framework for speech generation to provide insights for effective codec design. We retrain existing high-performing neural codec models on the same data set and loss functions to compare their performance in a uniform setting. We integrate codec tokens into two SLM systems: masked-based parallel speech generation system and an auto-regressive (AR) plus non-auto-regressive (NAR) model-based system. Our findings indicate that better speech reconstruction in codec systems does not guarantee improved speech generation in SLM. A high-quality codec decoder is crucial for natural speech production in SLM, while speech intelligibility depends more on quantization mechanism.</p></details> | 2024-09-09 | Accepted by SLT-2024 |

Although prior work has studied adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks. It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant behavioral vulnerability.

However, these methods typically create only a limited number of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of triggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher attack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this challenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack (SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two speech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger effectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.</p></details> | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tuning Large language model for End-to-end Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02050v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), multimodal models based on LLMs have demonstrated significant potential. Models such as LLaSM, X-LLM, and SpeechGPT exhibit an impressive ability to comprehend and generate human instructions. However, their performance often falters when faced with complex tasks like end-to-end speech translation (E2E-ST), a cross-language and cross-modal translation task. In comparison to single-modal models, multimodal models lag behind in these scenarios. This paper introduces LST, a Large multimodal model designed to excel at the E2E-ST task. LST consists of a speech frontend, an adapter, and a LLM backend. The training of LST consists of two stages: (1) Modality adjustment, where the adapter is tuned to align speech representation with text embedding space, and (2) Downstream task fine-tuning, where both the adapter and LLM model are trained to optimize performance on the E2EST task. Experimental results on the MuST-C speech translation benchmark demonstrate that LST-13B achieves BLEU scores of 30.39/41.55/35.33 on En-De/En-Fr/En-Es language pairs, surpassing previous models and establishing a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of single-modal model selection and the impact of training strategies, which lays the foundation for future research. We will open up our code and models after review.</p></details> | 2023-10-04 |  |

| **[Dual Information Speech Language Models for Emotional Conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08095v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs) often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information within contextual settings.</p></details> | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Speech Language Modeling via Energy Distance in Continuous Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13181v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.</p></details> | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Demos and code are available at https://github.com/ictnlp/SLED-TTS</p></details> |
| **[SEAL: Speech Embedding Alignment Learning for Speech Large Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02603v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding-based retrieval models have made significant strides in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques for text and multimodal large language models (LLMs) applications. However, when it comes to speech larage language models (SLLMs), these methods are limited to a two-stage process, where automatic speech recognition (ASR) is combined with text-based retrieval. This sequential architecture suffers from high latency and error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose a unified embedding framework that eliminates the need for intermediate text representations. Specifically, the framework includes separate speech and text encoders, followed by a shared scaling layer that maps both modalities into a common embedding space. Our model reduces pipeline latency by 50\% while achieving higher retrieval accuracy compared to traditional two-stage methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the challenges inherent in end-to-end speech retrieval and introduce architectural principles for effective speech-to-document matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach across diverse acoustic conditions and speaker variations, paving the way for a new paradigm in multimodal SLLMs retrieval systems.</p></details> | 2025-02-06 |  |
| **[Few-Shot Spoken Language Understanding via Joint Speech-Text Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05919v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on speech representation models jointly pre-trained with text has demonstrated the potential of improving speech representations by encoding speech and text in a shared space. In this paper, we leverage such shared representations to address the persistent challenge of limited data availability in spoken language understanding tasks. By employing a pre-trained speech-text model, we find that models fine-tuned on text can be effectively transferred to speech testing data. With as little as 1 hour of labeled speech data, our proposed approach achieves comparable performance on spoken language understanding tasks (specifically, sentiment analysis and named entity recognition) when compared to previous methods using speech-only pre-trained models fine-tuned on 10 times more data. Beyond the proof-of-concept study, we also analyze the latent representations. We find that the bottom layers of speech-text models are largely task-agnostic and align speech and text representations into a shared space, while the top layers are more task-specific.</p></details> | 2023-10-10 |  |
| **[Leveraging Pre-trained Language Model for Speech Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06598v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore the use of pre-trained language models to learn sentiment information of written texts for speech sentiment analysis. First, we investigate how useful a pre-trained language model would be in a 2-step pipeline approach employing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and transcripts-based sentiment analysis separately. Second, we propose a pseudo label-based semi-supervised training strategy using a language model on an end-to-end speech sentiment approach to take advantage of a large, but unlabeled speech dataset for training. Although spoken and written texts have different linguistic characteristics, they can complement each other in understanding sentiment. Therefore, the proposed system can not only model acoustic characteristics to bear sentiment-specific information in speech signals, but learn latent information to carry sentiments in the text representation. In these experiments, we demonstrate the proposed approaches improve F1 scores consistently compared to systems without a language model. Moreover, we also show that the proposed framework can reduce 65% of human supervision by leveraging a large amount of data without human sentiment annotation and boost performance in a low-resource condition where the human sentiment annotation is not available enough.</p></details> | 2021-06-15 | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Interspeech 2021</p></details> |
