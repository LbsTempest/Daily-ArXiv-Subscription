| **[SoulX-Podcast: Towards Realistic Long-form Podcasts with Dialectal and Paralinguistic Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23541v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis have significantly improved speech expressiveness and naturalness. However, most existing systems are tailored for single-speaker synthesis and fall short in generating coherent multi-speaker conversational speech. This technical report presents SoulX-Podcast, a system designed for podcast-style multi-turn, multi-speaker dialogic speech generation, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance in conventional TTS tasks. To meet the higher naturalness demands of multi-turn spoken dialogue, SoulX-Podcast integrates a range of paralinguistic controls and supports both Mandarin and English, as well as several Chinese dialects, including Sichuanese, Henanese, and Cantonese, enabling more personalized podcast-style speech generation. Experimental results demonstrate that SoulX-Podcast can continuously produce over 90 minutes of conversation with stable speaker timbre and smooth speaker transitions. Moreover, speakers exhibit contextually adaptive prosody, reflecting natural rhythm and intonation changes as dialogues progress. Across multiple evaluation metrics, SoulX-Podcast achieves state-of-the-art performance in both monologue TTS and multi-turn conversational speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2025-10-28 |  |
| **[DrVoice: Parallel Speech-Text Voice Conversation Model via Dual-Resolution Speech Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09349v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on end-to-end (E2E) speech generation with large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing E2E approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual modality awareness during generation. This paper presents DrVoice, a parallel speech-text voice conversation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring dual-resolution speech representations. Notably, while current methods utilize mainly 12.5Hz input audio representation, our proposed dual-resolution mechanism reduces the input frequency for the LLM to 5Hz, significantly reducing computational cost and alleviating the frequency discrepancy between speech and text tokens and in turn better exploiting LLMs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DRVOICE-7B establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on OpenAudioBench and Big Bench Audio benchmarks, while achieving performance comparable to the SOTA on VoiceBench and UltraEval-Audio benchmarks, making it a leading open-source speech foundation model in ~7B models.</p></details> | 2025-10-28 | Work in progress |
| **[SFMS-ALR: Script-First Multilingual Speech Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25178v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intra-sentence multilingual speech synthesis (code-switching TTS) remains a major challenge due to abrupt language shifts, varied scripts, and mismatched prosody between languages. Conventional TTS systems are typically monolingual and fail to produce natural, intelligible speech in mixed-language contexts. We introduce Script-First Multilingual Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution (SFMS-ALR), an engine-agnostic framework for fluent, real-time code-switched speech generation. SFMS-ALR segments input text by Unicode script, applies adaptive language identification to determine each segment's language and locale, and normalizes prosody using sentiment-aware adjustments to preserve expressive continuity across languages. The algorithm generates a unified SSML representation with appropriate "lang" or "voice" spans and synthesizes the utterance in a single TTS request. Unlike end-to-end multilingual models, SFMS-ALR requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with existing voices from Google, Apple, Amazon, and other providers. Comparative analysis with data-driven pipelines such as Unicom and Mask LID demonstrates SFMS-ALR's flexibility, interpretability, and immediate deployability. The framework establishes a modular baseline for high-quality, engine-independent multilingual TTS and outlines evaluation strategies for intelligibility, naturalness, and user preference.</p></details> | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[UltraVoice: Scaling Fine-Grained Style-Controlled Speech Conversations for Spoken Dialogue Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22588v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoken dialogue models currently lack the ability for fine-grained speech style control, a critical capability for human-like interaction that is often overlooked in favor of purely functional capabilities like reasoning and question answering. To address this limitation, we introduce UltraVoice, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice. Moreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset's utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis. The complete dataset and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/bigai-nlco/UltraVoice.</p></details> | 2025-10-26 | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Efficient Speech Language Modeling via Energy Distance in Continuous Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13181v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.</p></details> | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Demos and code are available at

| **[Continuous-Token Diffusion for Speaker-Referenced TTS in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12995v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified architectures in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have shown promise in handling diverse tasks within a single framework. In the text-to-speech (TTS) task, current MLLM-based approaches rely on discrete token representations, which disregard the inherently continuous nature of speech and can lead to loss of fine-grained acoustic information. In this work, we investigate the TTS within the MLLM paradigm using continuous speech representations. We design a dual-head architecture and implement two complementary training strategies for a robust model. (1) A diffusion head generating continuous speech representations is added on the MLLM, which is on frame-level and strictly autoregressive. (2) The original language model head is retained to preserve multitask capability and to control the start and end of speech synthesis. (3) Masked training is employed to address exposure bias in autoregressive decoding. (4) To stabilize optimization, we propose a two-stage scheme where the LM is frozen in the second stage, ensuring the diffusion head learns from a fixed input distribution. Evaluations on LibriSpeech(PC) test-clean show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art autoregressive performance, with a WER of 1.95%, speaker similarity of 0.54, and UTMOS of 4.00. The two-stage training yields a 46% relative WER reduction over the one-stage training baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining autoregressive modeling with continuous-token diffusion, supported by a two-stage training procedure.</p></details> | 2025-10-23 |  |
| **[Shallow Flow Matching for Coarse-to-Fine Text-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12226v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Shallow Flow Matching (SFM), a novel mechanism that enhances flow matching (FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Unlike conventional FM modules, which use the coarse representations from the weak generator as conditions, SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths from these representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise, thereby focusing computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments demonstrate that SFM yields consistent gains in speech naturalness across both objective and subjective evaluations, and significantly accelerates inference when using adaptive-step ODE solvers. Demo and codes are available at https://ydqmkkx.github.io/SFMDemo/.</p></details> | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vox-Evaluator: Enhancing Stability and Fidelity for Zero-shot TTS with A Multi-Level Evaluator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20210v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), driven by language models, diffusion models and masked generation, have achieved impressive naturalness in speech synthesis. Nevertheless, stability and fidelity remain key challenges, manifesting as mispronunciations, audible noise, and quality degradation. To address these issues, we introduce Vox-Evaluator, a multi-level evaluator designed to guide the correction of erroneous speech segments and preference alignment for TTS systems. It is capable of identifying the temporal boundaries of erroneous segments and providing a holistic quality assessment of the generated speech. Specifically, to refine erroneous segments and enhance the robustness of the zero-shot TTS model, we propose to automatically identify acoustic errors with the evaluator, mask the erroneous segments, and finally regenerate speech conditioning on the correct portions. In addition, the fine-gained information obtained from Vox-Evaluator can guide the preference alignment for TTS model, thereby reducing the bad cases in speech synthesis. Due to the lack of suitable training datasets for the Vox-Evaluator, we also constructed a synthesized text-speech dataset annotated with fine-grained pronunciation errors or audio quality issues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Vox-Evaluator in enhancing the stability and fidelity of TTS systems through the speech correction mechanism and preference optimization. The demos are shown.</p></details> | 2025-10-23 | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[U-Codec: Ultra Low Frame-rate Neural Speech Codec for Fast High-fidelity Speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16718v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose \textbf{U-Codec}, an \textbf{U}ltra low frame-rate neural speech \textbf{Codec} that achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and fast speech generation at an extremely low frame-rate of 5Hz (5 frames per second). Extreme compression at 5Hz typically leads to severe intelligibility and spectral detail loss, we introduce a Transformer-based inter-frame long-term dependency module and systematically explore residual vector quantization (RVQ) depth and codebook size to identify optimal configurations. Moreover, we apply U-Codec into a large language model (LLM)-based auto-regressive TTS model, which leverages global and local hierarchical architecture to effectively capture dependencies across multi-layer tokens. We extend LLM-based TTS from 3-layer RVQ at 50Hz to 32-layer RVQ at 5Hz. Experimental results demonstrate that U-Codec improves LLM-based TTS inference speed by around 3 $\times$ over high-frame-rate codecs while maintaining similarity and naturalness. These results validate the feasibility of using highly compressed 5Hz discrete tokens for fast and high-fidelity speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2025-10-19 |  |
| **[DiEmo-TTS: Disentangled Emotion Representations via Self-Supervised Distillation for Cross-Speaker Emotion Transfer in Text-to-Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19687v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion embeddings.</p></details> | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[RLAIF-SPA: Optimizing LLM-based Emotional Speech Synthesis via RLAIF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14628v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech, but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech, leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization. Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.</p></details> | 2025-10-16 |  |
| **[Closing the Gap Between Text and Speech Understanding in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13632v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap: the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text. Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text. Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.</p></details> | 2025-10-15 |  |
| **[ParsVoice: A Large-Scale Multi-Speaker Persian Speech Corpus for Text-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10774v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Persian speech datasets are typically smaller than their English counterparts, which creates a key limitation for developing Persian speech technologies. We address this gap by introducing ParsVoice, the largest Persian speech corpus designed specifically for text-to-speech(TTS) applications. We created an automated pipeline that transforms raw audiobook content into TTS-ready data, incorporating components such as a BERT-based sentence completion detector, a binary search boundary optimization method for precise audio-text alignment, and audio-text quality assessment frameworks tailored to Persian. The pipeline processes 2,000 audiobooks, yielding 3,526 hours of clean speech, which was further filtered into a 1,804-hour high-quality subset suitable for TTS, featuring more than 470 speakers. To validate the dataset, we fine-tuned XTTS for Persian, achieving a naturalness Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 3.6/5 and a Speaker Similarity Mean Opinion Score (SMOS) of 4.0/5 demonstrating ParsVoice's effectiveness for training multi-speaker TTS systems. ParsVoice is the largest high-quality Persian speech dataset, offering speaker diversity and audio quality comparable to major English corpora. The complete dataset has been made publicly available to accelerate the development of Persian speech technologies. The ParsVoice dataset is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/ParsVoice.</p></details> | 2025-10-14 |  |
| **[BridgeCode: A Dual Speech Representation Paradigm for Autoregressive Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11646v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) frameworks have recently achieved remarkable progress in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) by leveraging discrete speech tokens and large language model techniques. Despite their success, existing AR-based zero-shot TTS systems face two critical limitations: (i) an inherent speed-quality trade-off, as sequential token generation either reduces frame rates at the cost of expressiveness or enriches tokens at the cost of efficiency, and (ii) a text-oriented supervision mismatch, as cross-entropy loss penalizes token errors uniformly without considering the fine-grained acoustic similarity among adjacent tokens. To address these challenges, we propose BridgeTTS, a novel AR-TTS framework built upon the dual speech representation paradigm BridgeCode. BridgeTTS reduces AR iterations by predicting sparse tokens while reconstructing rich continuous features for high-quality synthesis. Joint optimization of token-level and feature-level objectives further enhances naturalness and intelligibility. Experiments demonstrate that BridgeTTS achieves competitive quality and speaker similarity while significantly accelerating synthesis. Speech demos are available at https://test1562.github.io/demo/.</p></details> | 2025-10-13 |  |
| **[Perturbation Self-Supervised Representations for Cross-Lingual Emotion TTS: Stage-Wise Modeling of Emotion and Speaker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11124v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual emotional text-to-speech (TTS) aims to produce speech in one language that captures the emotion of a speaker from another language while maintaining the target voice's timbre. This process of cross-lingual emotional speech synthesis presents a complex challenge, necessitating flexible control over emotion, timbre, and language. However, emotion and timbre are highly entangled in speech signals, making fine-grained control challenging. To address this issue, we propose EMM-TTS, a novel two-stage cross-lingual emotional speech synthesis framework based on perturbed self-supervised learning (SSL) representations. In the first stage, the model explicitly and implicitly encodes prosodic cues to capture emotional expressiveness, while the second stage restores the timbre from perturbed SSL representations. We further investigate the effect of different speaker perturbation strategies-formant shifting and speaker anonymization-on the disentanglement of emotion and timbre. To strengthen speaker preservation and expressive control, we introduce Speaker Consistency Loss (SCL) and Speaker-Emotion Adaptive Layer Normalization (SEALN) modules. Additionally, we find that incorporating explicit acoustic features (e.g., F0, energy, and duration) alongside pretrained latent features improves voice cloning performance. Comprehensive multi-metric evaluations, including both subjective and objective measures, demonstrate that EMM-TTS achieves superior naturalness, emotion transferability, and timbre consistency across languages.</p></details> | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Expert Systems with Applications,11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Discrete-Time Diffusion-Like Models for Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18470v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.</p></details> | 2025-10-13 |  |
| **[Paper2Video: Automatic Video Generation from Scientific Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05096v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10 minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To address these challenges, we introduce Paper2Video, the first benchmark of 101 research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding, subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.</p></details> | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://showlab.github.io/Paper2Video/</p></details> |
| **[DialoSpeech: Dual-Speaker Dialogue Generation with LLM and Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08373v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, particularly those leveraging large language models (LLMs), have significantly improved expressiveness and naturalness. However, generating human-like, interactive dialogue speech remains challenging. Current systems face limitations due to the scarcity of dual-track data and difficulties in achieving naturalness, contextual coherence, and interactional dynamics, such as turn-taking, overlapping speech, and speaker consistency, in multi-turn conversations. To address these challenges, we propose DialoSpeech, a dual-track architecture combining a large language model with Chunked Flow Matching for expressive, human-like dialogue speech synthesis. DialoSpeech generates natural multi-turn conversations with coherent speaker turns and natural overlaps, supporting both Chinese and English and cross-lingual speech synthesis. We introduce a data processing pipeline to construct dual-track dialogue datasets, facilitating scalable training and experimental validation. Experiments show that our model outperforms baselines, offering a solution for generating human-like spoken dialogues.

| **[IntMeanFlow: Few-step Speech Generation with Integral Velocity Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07979v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-based generative models have greatly improved text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis quality, but inference speed remains limited by the iterative sampling process and multiple function evaluations (NFE). The recent MeanFlow model accelerates generation by modeling average velocity instead of instantaneous velocity. However, its direct application to TTS encounters challenges, including GPU memory overhead from Jacobian-vector products (JVP) and training instability due to self-bootstrap processes. To address these issues, we introduce IntMeanFlow, a framework for few-step speech generation with integral velocity distillation. By approximating average velocity with the teacher's instantaneous velocity over a temporal interval, IntMeanFlow eliminates the need for JVPs and self-bootstrap, improving stability and reducing GPU memory usage. We also propose the Optimal Step Sampling Search (O3S) algorithm, which identifies the model-specific optimal sampling steps, improving speech synthesis without additional inference overhead. Experiments show that IntMeanFlow achieves 1-NFE inference for token-to-spectrogram and 3-NFE for text-to-spectrogram tasks while maintaining high-quality synthesis. Demo samples are available at https://vvwangvv.github.io/intmeanflow.</p></details> | 2025-10-09 |  |
| **[Making Machines Sound Sarcastic: LLM-Enhanced and Retrieval-Guided Sarcastic Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07096v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic, contextual, and prosodic cues. While existing speech synthesis research has focused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis. Our approach combines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic exemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which provide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within a VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually appropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations, yielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and downstream sarcasm detection.</p></details> | 2025-10-08 |  |
| **[XLSR-Kanformer: A KAN-Intergrated model for Synthetic Speech Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06706v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in speech synthesis technologies have led to increasingly sophisticated spoofing attacks, posing significant challenges for automatic speaker verification systems. While systems based on self-supervised learning (SSL) models, particularly the XLSR-Conformer architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance in synthetic speech detection, there remains room for architectural improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that replaces the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in the XLSR-Conformer model with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a powerful universal approximator based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Our experimental results on ASVspoof2021 demonstrate that the integration of KAN to XLSR-Conformer model can improve the performance by 60.55% relatively in Equal Error Rate (EER) LA and DF sets, further achieving 0.70% EER on the 21LA set. Besides, the proposed replacement is also robust to various SSL architectures. These findings suggest that incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for advances in synthetic speech detection.</p></details> | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and

| **[ECTSpeech: Enhancing Efficient Speech Synthesis via Easy Consistency Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05984v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in speech synthesis, but typically require multi-step sampling, resulting in low inference efficiency. Recent studies address this issue by distilling diffusion models into consistency models, enabling efficient one-step generation. However, these approaches introduce additional training costs and rely heavily on the performance of pre-trained teacher models. In this paper, we propose ECTSpeech, a simple and effective one-step speech synthesis framework that, for the first time, incorporates the Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) strategy into speech synthesis. By progressively tightening consistency constraints on a pre-trained diffusion model, ECTSpeech achieves high-quality one-step generation while significantly reducing training complexity. In addition, we design a multi-scale gate module (MSGate) to enhance the denoiser's ability to fuse features at different scales. Experimental results on the LJSpeech dataset demonstrate that ECTSpeech achieves audio quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods under single-step sampling, while substantially reducing the model's training cost and complexity.</p></details> | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by Proceedings of the 2025 ACM Multimedia

| **[Sparse deepfake detection promotes better disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05696v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the rapid progress of speech synthesis, deepfake detection has become a major concern in the speech processing community. Because it is a critical task, systems must not only be efficient and robust, but also provide interpretable explanations. Among the different approaches for explainability, we focus on the interpretation of latent representations. In such paper, we focus on the last layer of embeddings of AASIST, a deepfake detection architecture. We use a TopK activation inspired by SAEs on this layer to obtain sparse representations which are used in the decision process. We demonstrate that sparse deepfake detection can improve detection performance, with an EER of 23.36% on ASVSpoof5 test set, with 95% of sparsity. We then show that these representations provide better disentanglement, using completeness and modularity metrics based on mutual information. Notably, some attacks are directly encoded in the latent space.</p></details> | 2025-10-07 |  |
| **[AlignDiT: Multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer for Synchronized Speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20629v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the task of multimodal-to-speech generation, which aims to synthesize high-quality speech from multiple input modalities: text, video, and reference audio. This task has gained increasing attention due to its wide range of applications, such as film production, dubbing, and virtual avatars. Despite recent progress, existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech intelligibility, audio-video synchronization, speech naturalness, and voice similarity to the reference speaker. To address these challenges, we propose AlignDiT, a multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer that generates accurate, synchronized, and natural-sounding speech from aligned multimodal inputs. Built upon the in-context learning capability of the DiT architecture, AlignDiT explores three effective strategies to align multimodal representations. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal classifier-free guidance mechanism that allows the model to adaptively balance information from each modality during speech synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignDiT significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks in terms of quality, synchronization, and speaker similarity. Moreover, AlignDiT exhibits strong generalization capability across various multimodal tasks, such as video-to-speech synthesis and visual forced alignment, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.

| **[BatonVoice: An Operationalist Framework for Enhancing Controllable Speech Synthesis with Linguistic Intelligence from LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26514v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a ``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual ``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.</p></details> | 2025-09-30 |  |
| **[HiStyle: Hierarchical Style Embedding Predictor for Text-Prompt-Guided Controllable Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25842v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern: embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces. Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0 contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units, which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.</p></details> | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[MGM-Omni: Scaling Omni LLMs to Personalized Long-Horizon Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25131v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions. For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences, producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient, end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised long-horizon speech generation.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/MGM-Omni</p></details> |
| **[VoxCPM: Tokenizer-Free TTS for Context-Aware Speech Generation and True-to-Life Voice Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24650v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for speech synthesis face a fundamental trade-off: discrete tokens ensure stability but sacrifice expressivity, while continuous signals retain acoustic richness but suffer from error accumulation due to task entanglement. This challenge has driven the field towards multi-stage pipelines that rely on pre-trained speech tokenizers, but these create a semantic-acoustic divide, limiting holistic and expressive speech generation. We resolve these dilemma through hierarchical semantic-acoustic modeling with semi-discrete residual representations and present a novel tokenizer-free TTS model VoxCPM. Our framework introduces a differentiable quantization bottleneck that induces natural specialization: a Text-Semantic Language Model (TSLM) generates semantic-prosodic plans, while a Residual Acoustic Model (RALM) recovers fine-grained acoustic details. This hierarchical semantic-acoustic representation guides a local diffusion-based decoder to generate high-fidelity speech latents. Critically, the entire architecture is trained end-to-end under a simple diffusion objective, eliminating dependency on external speech tokenizers. Trained on a massive 1.8 million hours of bilingual corpus, our VoxCPM-0.5B model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS performance among open-source systems, demonstrating that our approach delivers expressive and stable synthesis. Besides, VoxCPM shows the capability to comprehend text to infer and generate appropriate prosody and style, delivering speech with context-aware expressiveness and natural flow. To facilitate community-driven research and development, VoxCPM is publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 | Technical Report |
| **[Word-Level Emotional Expression Control in Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24629v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While emotional text-to-speech (TTS) has made significant progress, most existing research remains limited to utterance-level emotional expression and fails to support word-level control. Achieving word-level expressive control poses fundamental challenges, primarily due to the complexity of modeling multi-emotion transitions and the scarcity of annotated datasets that capture intra-sentence emotional and prosodic variation. In this paper, we propose WeSCon, the first self-training framework that enables word-level control of both emotion and speaking rate in a pretrained zero-shot TTS model, without relying on datasets containing intra-sentence emotion or speed transitions. Our method introduces a transition-smoothing strategy and a dynamic speed control mechanism to guide the pretrained TTS model in performing word-level expressive synthesis through a multi-round inference process. To further simplify the inference, we incorporate a dynamic emotional attention bias mechanism and fine-tune the model via self-training, thereby activating its ability for word-level expressive control in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that WeSCon effectively overcomes data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in word-level emotional expression control while preserving the strong zero-shot synthesis capabilities of the original TTS model.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 |  |

However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks.

| **[UniFlow-Audio: Unified Flow Matching for Audio Generation from Omni-Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24391v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio generation, including speech, music and sound effects, has advanced rapidly in recent years. These tasks can be divided into two categories: time-aligned (TA) tasks, where each input unit corresponds to a specific segment of the output audio (e.g., phonemes aligned with frames in speech synthesis); and non-time-aligned (NTA) tasks, where such alignment is not available. Since modeling paradigms for the two types are typically different, research on different audio generation tasks has traditionally followed separate trajectories. However, audio is not inherently divided into such categories, making a unified model a natural and necessary goal for general audio generation. Previous unified audio generation works have adopted autoregressive architectures, while unified non-autoregressive approaches remain largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniFlow-Audio, a universal audio generation framework based on flow matching. We propose a dual-fusion mechanism that temporally aligns audio latents with TA features and integrates NTA features via cross-attention in each model block. Task-balanced data sampling is employed to maintain strong performance across both TA and NTA tasks. UniFlow-Audio supports omni-modalities, including text, audio, and video. By leveraging the advantage of multi-task learning and the generative modeling capabilities of flow matching, UniFlow-Audio achieves strong results across 7 tasks using fewer than 8K hours of public training data and under 1B trainable parameters. Even the small variant with only ~200M trainable parameters shows competitive performance, highlighting UniFlow-Audio as a potential non-auto-regressive foundation model for audio generation.

We introduce Sidon, a fast, open-source speech restoration model that converts noisy in-the-wild speech into studio-quality speech and scales to dozens of languages. Sidon consists of two models: w2v-BERT 2.0 finetuned feature predictor to cleanse features from noisy speech and vocoder trained to synthesize restored speech from the cleansed features. Sidon achieves restoration performance comparable to Miipher: Google's internal speech restoration model with the aim of dataset cleansing for speech synthesis. Sidon is also computationally efficient, running up to 500 times faster than real time on a single GPU. We further show that training a TTS model using a Sidon-cleansed automatic speech recognition corpus improves the quality of synthetic speech in a zero-shot setting. Code and model are released to facilitate reproducible dataset cleansing for the research community.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 | 5 pages, 1 figures |

Speech deepfake detection is challenging due to distribution shifts across spoofing methods and variability in speakers, channels, and recording conditions. We explore learning shared discriminative features as a path to robust detection and propose Information Bottleneck enhanced Confidence-Aware Adversarial Network (IB-CAAN). Confidence-guided adversarial alignment adaptively suppresses attack-specific artifacts without erasing discriminative cues, while the information bottleneck removes nuisance variability to preserve transferable features. Experiments on ASVspoof 2019/2021, ASVspoof 5, and In-the-Wild demonstrate that IB-CAAN consistently outperforms baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks.</p></details> | 2025-09-28 |  |

However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 |  |

Given the vulnerable population, protecting speaker identity is particularly important, as speech itself can reveal personally identifiable information if the data is leaked or maliciously exploited. This work presents the first systematic study of speaker anonymisation for speech-based suicide risk detection. A broad range of anonymisation methods are investigated, including techniques based on traditional signal processing, neural voice conversion, and speech synthesis. A comprehensive evaluation framework is built to assess the trade-off between protecting speaker identity and preserving information essential for suicide risk detection. Results show that combining anonymisation methods that retain complementary information yields detection performance comparable to that of original speech, while achieving protection of speaker identity for vulnerable populations.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 |  |
| **[Comprehend and Talk: Text to Speech Synthesis via Dual Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22062v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Large Language Model (LLM) based autoregressive (AR) text-to-speech (TTS) systems, while achieving state-of-the-art quality, still face critical challenges. The foundation of this LLM-based paradigm is the discretization of the continuous speech waveform into a sequence of discrete tokens by neural audio codec. However, single codebook modeling is well suited to text LLMs, but suffers from significant information loss; hierarchical acoustic tokens, typically generated via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), often lack explicit semantic structure, placing a heavy learning burden on the model. Furthermore, the autoregressive process is inherently susceptible to error accumulation, which can degrade generation stability. To address these limitations, we propose CaT-TTS, a novel framework for robust and semantically-grounded zero-shot synthesis. First, we introduce S3Codec, a split RVQ codec that injects explicit linguistic features into its primary codebook via semantic distillation from a state-of-the-art ASR model, providing a structured representation that simplifies the learning task. Second, we propose an ``Understand-then-Generate'' dual-Transformer architecture that decouples comprehension from rendering. An initial ``Understanding'' Transformer models the cross-modal relationship between text and the audio's semantic tokens to form a high-level utterance plan. A subsequent ``Generation'' Transformer then executes this plan, autoregressively synthesizing hierarchical acoustic tokens. Finally, to enhance generation stability, we introduce Masked Audio Parallel Inference (MAPI), a nearly parameter-free inference strategy that dynamically guides the decoding process to mitigate local errors.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference paper about TTS</p></details> |

Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency, which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency on par with the baseline.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 |  |

This creates significant obstacles in dataset curation since actual recording of long, articulate sentences for the objective of training personalized TTS models becomes infeasible. Thus, the limited availability of audio data, in addition to the articulation errors that are present within the audio, complicates personalized speech synthesis for target dysarthric speaker adaptation. To address this, we frame the issue as a domain transfer task and introduce a knowledge anchoring framework that leverages a teacher-student model, enhanced by curriculum learning through audio augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model effectively generates synthetic speech with markedly reduced articulation errors and high speaker fidelity, while maintaining prosodic naturalness.</p></details> | 2025-09-25 | Interspeech 2025 |

Traditional methods rely on discrete emotion labels to control emotion categories and intensities, which cannot capture the complexity and continuity of human emotional perception and expression. The lack of large-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and fine-grained emotional annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models and impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose UDDETTS, a universal LLM framework unifying discrete and dimensional emotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the interpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion description and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion labels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised training strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech datasets with different types of emotional annotations to train the UDDETTS. Experiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along three interpretable dimensions, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech synthesis capabilities.

Word Error Rate (WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.</p></details> | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for IEEE OJSP</p></details> |

While recent progress in discrete codec-based speech synthesis has enabled zero-shot generation via in-context learning, directly extending these techniques to SVS remains non-trivial due to the requirement for precise melody control. In particular, prompt-based generation often introduces prosody leakage, where pitch information is inadvertently entangled within the timbre prompt, compromising controllability. We present CoMelSinger, a zero-shot SVS framework that enables structured and disentangled melody control within a discrete codec modeling paradigm. Built on the non-autoregressive MaskGCT architecture, CoMelSinger replaces conventional text inputs with lyric and pitch tokens, preserving in-context generalization while enhancing melody conditioning. To suppress prosody leakage, we propose a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning strategy that explicitly regularizes pitch redundancy between the acoustic prompt and melody input. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight encoder-only Singing Voice Transcription (SVT) module to align acoustic tokens with pitch and duration, offering fine-grained frame-level supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMelSinger achieves notable improvements in pitch accuracy, timbre consistency, and zero-shot transferability over competitive baselines.</p></details> | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Speech watermarking offers a viable solution for tracing sources and preventing misuse. Current watermarking technologies fall mainly into two categories: DSP-based methods and deep learning-based methods. DSP-based methods are efficient but vulnerable to attacks, whereas deep learning-based methods offer robust protection at the expense of significantly higher computational cost. To improve the computational efficiency and enhance the robustness, we propose PKDMark, a lightweight deep learning-based speech watermarking method that leverages progressive knowledge distillation (PKD). Our approach proceeds in two stages: (1) training a high-performance teacher model using an invertible neural network-based architecture, and (2) transferring the teacher's capabilities to a compact student model through progressive knowledge distillation. This process reduces computational costs by 93.6% while maintaining high level of robust performance and imperceptibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled model achieves an average detection F1 score of 99.6% with a PESQ of 4.30 in advanced distortions, enabling efficient speech watermarking for real-time speech synthesis applications.</p></details> | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages of main text, 1 page of references, 2 figures, 2 tables,

While classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategies have shown promising results in image generation, their application to speech synthesis are underexplored. Separating the conditions used for CFG enables trade-offs between different desired characteristics in speech synthesis. In this paper, we evaluate the adaptability of CFG strategies originally developed for image generation to speech synthesis and extend separated-condition CFG approaches for this domain. Our results show that CFG strategies effective in image generation generally fail to improve speech synthesis. We also find that we can improve speaker similarity while limiting degradation of text adherence by applying standard CFG during early timesteps and switching to selective CFG only in later timesteps. Surprisingly, we observe that the effectiveness of a selective CFG strategy is highly text-representation dependent, as differences between the two languages of English and Mandarin can lead to different results even with the same model.</p></details> | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

SupertonicTTS comprises three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. The TTS pipeline is further simplified by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we propose context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment with minimal memory and I/O overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that SupertonicTTS delivers performance comparable to contemporary zero-shot TTS models with only 44M parameters, while significantly reducing architectural complexity and computational cost.

However, the precision control of TTS inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis.

The lack of high-quality omnimodal datasets and the challenges of real-time emotional speech synthesis have notably hindered progress in open-source research. To address these limitations, we introduce \name, a two-stage training framework that integrates omnimodal alignment and speech generation to develop a state-of-the-art omnimodal large language model. In the alignment phase, a pre-trained speech model undergoes further training on text-image tasks, enabling (near) zero-shot generalization from vision to speech, outperforming models trained on tri-modal datasets. In the speech generation phase, a lightweight decoder is trained on speech tasks with direct preference optimization, enabling real-time emotional speech synthesis with high fidelity.

To address this issue, we propose TMD-TTS, a unified Tibetan multi-dialect text-to-speech (TTS) framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from explicit dialect labels. Our method features a dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that TMD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in dialectal expressiveness. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging Speech-to-Speech Dialect Conversion (S2SDC) task.</p></details> | 2025-09-22 |  |
| **[Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2025-09-20 |  |

However, most current flow-matching-based TTS models still rely on reference transcripts corresponding to the audio prompt for synthesis. This dependency prevents cross-lingual voice cloning when audio prompt transcripts are unavailable, particularly for unseen languages. The key challenges for flow-matching-based TTS models to remove audio prompt transcripts are identifying word boundaries during training and determining appropriate duration during inference. In this paper, we introduce Cross-Lingual F5-TTS, a framework that enables cross-lingual voice cloning without audio prompt transcripts. Our method preprocesses audio prompts by forced alignment to obtain word boundaries, enabling direct synthesis from audio prompts while excluding transcripts during training. To address the duration modeling challenge, we train speaking rate predictors at different linguistic granularities to derive duration from speaker pace. Experiments show that our approach matches the performance of F5-TTS while enabling cross-lingual voice cloning.</p></details> | 2025-09-20 | 5 pages, 2 figures |

While existing video-to-audio (V2A) methods mainly focus on Foley sound generation, they struggle to produce intelligible speech. Meanwhile, current environmental speech synthesis approaches remain text-driven and fail to temporally align with dynamic video content. In this paper, we propose Beyond Video-to-SFX (BVS), a method to generate synchronized audio with environmentally aware intelligible speech for given videos. We introduce a two-stage modeling method: (1) stage one is a video-guided audio semantic (V2AS) model to predict unified audio semantic tokens conditioned on phonetic cues; (2) stage two is a video-conditioned semantic-to-acoustic (VS2A) model that refines semantic tokens into detailed acoustic tokens. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BVS in scenarios such as video-to-context-aware speech synthesis and immersive audio background conversion, with ablation studies further validating our design. Our demonstration is available at~\href{https://xinleiniu.github.io/BVS-demo/}{BVS-Demo}.</p></details> | 2025-09-19 |  |

By leveraging separate speaker and environment prompts, DAIEN-TTS allows independent control over the timbre and the background environment of the synthesized speech. Built upon F5-TTS, the proposed DAIEN-TTS first incorporates a pretrained speech-environment separation (SES) module to disentangle the environmental speech into mel-spectrograms of clean speech and environment audio. Two random span masks of varying lengths are then applied to both mel-spectrograms, which, together with the text embedding, serve as conditions for infilling the masked environmental mel-spectrogram, enabling the simultaneous continuation of personalized speech and time-varying environmental audio. To further enhance controllability during inference, we adopt dual class-free guidance (DCFG) for the speech and environment components and introduce a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation strategy to align the synthesized speech with the environment prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that DAIEN-TTS generates environmental personalized speech with high naturalness, strong speaker similarity, and high environmental fidelity.</p></details> | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Existing methods model speaker characteristics through speaker conditioning during training, leading to increased model complexity and limiting reproducibility and accessibility. A low-complexity alternative would broaden the reach of speech synthesis research, particularly in settings with limited computational and data resources. To this end, we propose SelectTTS, a simple and effective alternative. SelectTTS selects appropriate frames from the target speaker and decodes them using frame-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features. We demonstrate that this approach can effectively capture speaker characteristics for unseen speakers and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art multi-speaker TTS frameworks on both objective and subjective metrics. By directly selecting frames from the target speaker's speech, SelectTTS enables generalization to unseen speakers with significantly lower model complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art systems such as XTTS-v2 and VALL-E, while requiring over 8x fewer parameters and 270x less training data. Moreover, it demonstrates that frame selection with SSL features offers an efficient path to low-complexity, high-quality multi-speaker TTS.</p></details> | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for IEEE OJSP</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods, KALL-E directly models the continuous speech distribution conditioned on text, eliminating the need for any diffusion-based components. Specifically, we utilize a Flow-VAE to extract a continuous latent speech representation from waveforms, instead of relying on discrete speech tokens. A single AR Transformer is then trained to predict these continuous speech distributions from text, optimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss as its objective. Experimental results demonstrate that KALL-E achieves superior speech synthesis quality and can even adapt to a target speaker from just a single sample. Importantly, KALL-E provides a more direct and effective approach for utilizing continuous speech representations in TTS.</p></details> | 2025-09-17 | 6 figures, 5 tables |
| **[Progressive Facial Granularity Aggregation with Bilateral Attribute-based Enhancement for Face-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07376v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For individuals who have experienced traumatic events such as strokes, speech may no longer be a viable means of communication. While text-to-speech (TTS) can be used as a communication aid since it generates synthetic speech, it fails to preserve the user's own voice. As such, face-to-voice (FTV) synthesis, which derives corresponding voices from facial images, provides a promising alternative. However, existing methods rely on pre-trained visual encoders, and finetune them to align with speech embeddings, which strips fine-grained information from facial inputs such as gender or ethnicity, despite their known correlation with vocal traits. Moreover, these pipelines are multi-stage, which requires separate training of multiple components, thus leading to training inefficiency. To address these limitations, we utilize fine-grained facial attribute modeling by decomposing facial images into non-overlapping segments and progressively integrating them into a multi-granular representation. This representation is further refined through multi-task learning of speaker attributes such as gender and ethnicity at both the visual and acoustic domains. Moreover, to improve alignment robustness, we adopt a multi-view training strategy by pairing various visual perspectives of a speaker in terms of different angles and lighting conditions, with identical speech recordings. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations confirm that our approach substantially enhances face-voice congruence and synthesis stability.</p></details> | 2025-09-14 | EMNLP Findings |
| **[DiFlow-TTS: Discrete Flow Matching with Factorized Speech Tokens for Low-Latency Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09631v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample, requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness, prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to 25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.</p></details> | 2025-09-12 |  |

Existing DiT-based text-to-speech (TTS) model acceleration approaches mainly focus on reducing sampling steps through distillation techniques, yet they remain constrained by training costs. We introduce DiTReducio, a training-free acceleration framework that compresses computations in DiT-based TTS models via progressive calibration. We propose two compression methods, Temporal Skipping and Branch Skipping, to eliminate redundant computations during inference. Moreover, based on two characteristic attention patterns identified within DiT layers, we devise a pattern-guided strategy to selectively apply the compression methods. Our method allows flexible modulation between generation quality and computational efficiency through adjustable compression thresholds. Experimental evaluations conducted on F5-TTS and MegaTTS 3 demonstrate that DiTReducio achieves a 75.4% reduction in FLOPs and improves the Real-Time Factor (RTF) by 37.1%, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> | 2025-09-11 |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a novel training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech. Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly. Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions with cross-modal information.</p></details> | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the ISCA SLaTE-2025 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[When Fine-Tuning is Not Enough: Lessons from HSAD on Hybrid and Adversarial Audio Spoof Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07323v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI has enabled highly realistic speech synthesis and voice cloning, posing serious risks to voice authentication, smart assistants, and telecom security. While most prior work frames spoof detection as a binary task, real-world attacks often involve hybrid utterances that mix genuine and synthetic speech, making detection substantially more challenging. To address this gap, we introduce the Hybrid Spoofed Audio Dataset (HSAD), a benchmark containing 1,248 clean and 41,044 degraded utterances across four classes: human, cloned, zero-shot AI-generated, and hybrid audio. Each sample is annotated with spoofing method, speaker identity, and degradation metadata to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate six transformer-based models, including spectrogram encoders (MIT-AST, MattyB95-AST) and self-supervised waveform models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT). Results reveal critical lessons: pretrained models overgeneralize and collapse under hybrid conditions; spoof-specific fine-tuning improves separability but struggles with unseen compositions; and dataset-specific adaptation on HSAD yields large performance gains (AST greater than 97 percent and F1 score is approximately 99 percent), though residual errors persist for complex hybrids. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuning alone is not sufficient-robust hybrid-aware benchmarks like HSAD are essential to expose calibration failures, model biases, and factors affecting spoof detection in adversarial environments. HSAD thus provides both a dataset and an analytic framework for building resilient and trustworthy voice authentication systems.</p></details> | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures.This work has been submitted to the IEEE for

The latest work predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MFCIG-CSS.</p></details> | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks, reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and automated evaluation.</p></details> | 2025-09-05 | 10 pages, 4 figures |

This uniform token allocation mismatches the intrinsic structure of speech, where information is distributed unevenly over time. To address this, we propose VARSTok, a VAriable-frame-Rate Speech Tokenizer that adapts token allocation based on local feature similarity. VARSTok introduces two key innovations: (1) a temporal-aware density peak clustering algorithm that adaptively segments speech into variable-length units, and (2) a novel implicit duration coding scheme that embeds both content and temporal span into a single token index, eliminating the need for auxiliary duration predictors. Extensive experiments show that VARSTok significantly outperforms strong fixed-rate baselines. Notably, it achieves superior reconstruction naturalness while using up to 23% fewer tokens than a 40 Hz fixed-frame-rate baseline. VARSTok further yields lower word error rates and improved naturalness in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that a fully dynamic, variable-frame-rate acoustic speech tokenizer can be seamlessly integrated into downstream speech language models.

To improve content encoding under strict latency constraints, DarkStream combines a causal waveform encoder, a short lookahead buffer, and transformer-based contextual layers. To further reduce inference time, the model generates waveforms directly via a neural vocoder, thus removing intermediate mel-spectrogram conversions. Finally, DarkStream anonymizes speaker identity by injecting a GAN-generated pseudo-speaker embedding into linguistic features from the content encoder. Evaluations show our model achieves strong anonymization, yielding close to 50% speaker verification EER (near-chance performance) on the lazy-informed attack scenario, while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within 9%). By balancing low-latency, robust privacy, and minimal intelligibility degradation, DarkStream provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving real-time speech communication.</p></details> | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ASRU 2025</p></details> |

Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed, their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale, highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice, underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.

| **[Exposing Synthetic Speech: Model Attribution and Detection of AI-generated Speech via Audio Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As speech generation technologies continue to advance in quality and accessibility, the risk of malicious use cases, including impersonation, misinformation, and spoofing, increases rapidly. This work addresses this threat by introducing a simple, training-free, yet effective approach for detecting AI-generated speech and attributing it to its source model. Specifically, we tackle three key tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether a given audio sample was generated by a specific target neural speech synthesis system (with access only to data from that system); (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world setting, where the objective is to identify the generating system from a known pool of candidates; and last but not least (3) detection of synthetic versus real speech. Our approach leverages standardized average residuals-the difference between an input audio signal and its filtered version using either a low-pass filter or the EnCodec audio autoencoder. We demonstrate that these residuals consistently capture artifacts introduced by diverse speech synthesis systems, serving as distinctive, model-agnostic fingerprints for attribution. Across extensive experiments, our approach achieves AUROC scores exceeding 99% in most scenarios, evaluated on augmented benchmark datasets that pair real speech with synthetic audio generated by multiple synthesis systems. In addition, our robustness analysis underscores the method's ability to maintain high performance even in the presence of moderate additive noise. Due to its simplicity, efficiency, and strong generalization across speech synthesis systems and languages, this technique offers a practical tool for digital forensics and security applications.</p></details> | 2025-09-04 |  |

We present two open-source dual-track conversational speech datasets, one in Chinese and one in English, designed to enhance the naturalness of synthesized speech by providing more realistic conversational data. The two datasets contain a total of 15 hours of natural, spontaneous conversations recorded in isolated rooms, which produces separate high-quality audio tracks for each speaker. The conversations cover diverse daily topics and domains, capturing realistic interaction patterns including frequent overlaps, backchannel responses, laughter, and other non-verbal vocalizations. We introduce the data collection procedure, transcription and annotation methods. We demonstrate the utility of these corpora by fine-tuning a baseline TTS model with the proposed datasets. The fine-tuned TTS model achieves higher subjective and objective evaluation metrics compared to the baseline, indicating improved naturalness and conversational realism in synthetic speech. All data, annotations, and supporting code for fine-tuning and evaluation are made available to facilitate further research in conversational speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2025-09-04 |  |

However, the proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear. Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally, we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at https://libriquote.github.io/.</p></details> | 2025-09-04 |  |

While these innovations hold promise for applications like assistive technologies, they also pose significant risks, including misuse for fraudulent activities, identity theft, and security threats. Current research on spoofing detection countermeasures remains limited by generalization to unseen deepfake attacks and languages. To address this, we propose a gating mechanism extracting relevant feature from the speech foundation XLS-R model as a front-end feature extractor. For downstream back-end classifier, we employ Multi-kernel gated Convolution (MultiConv) to capture both local and global speech artifacts. Additionally, we introduce Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a similarity metric to enforce diversity in learned features across different MultiConv layers. By integrating CKA with our gating mechanism, we hypothesize that each component helps improving the learning of distinct synthetic speech patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks while generalizing robustly to out-of-domain datasets, including multilingual speech samples. This underscores its potential as a versatile solution for detecting evolving speech deepfake threats.</p></details> | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

For each continuous-valued token, FELLE modifies the general prior distribution in flow matching by incorporating information from the previous step, improving coherence and stability. Furthermore, to enhance synthesis quality, FELLE introduces a coarse-to-fine flow-matching mechanism, generating continuous-valued tokens hierarchically, conditioned on the language model's output. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of incorporating flow-matching techniques in autoregressive mel-spectrogram modeling, leading to significant improvements in TTS generation quality, as shown in https://aka.ms/felle.</p></details> | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

Utilizing a pre-trained voice SSL model, we train a T5 encoder to produce pseudo-language labels from mixed-script texts (e.g., containing Kanji and Kana). This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription, reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed audio datasets.

However, for individuals with visual impairments, navigating in supermarkets and identifying products can be an overwhelming and challenging experience. This paper presents an AI-based shopping assistant prototype designed to enhance the autonomy and inclusivity of visually impaired individuals in supermarket environments. The system integrates multiple technologies, including computer vision, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and indoor navigation, into a single, user-friendly platform.

| **[FreeTalk:A plug-and-play and black-box defense against speech synthesis attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00561v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, speech assistant and speech verification have been used in many fields, which brings much benefit and convenience for us. However, when we enjoy these speech applications, our speech may be collected by attackers for speech synthesis. For example, an attacker generates some inappropriate political opinions with the characteristic of the victim's voice by obtaining a piece of the victim's speech, which will greatly influence the victim's reputation. Specifically, with the appearance of some zero-shot voice conversion methods, the cost of speech synthesis attacks has been further reduced, which also brings greater challenges to user voice security and privacy. Some researchers have proposed the corresponding privacy-preserving methods. However, the existing approaches have some non-negligible drawbacks: low transferability and robustness, high computational overhead. These deficiencies seriously limit the existing method deployed in practical scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight, robust, plug-and-play privacy preservation method against speech synthesis attacks in a black-box setting. Our method generates and adds a frequency-domain perturbation to the original speech to achieve privacy protection and high speech quality. Then, we present a data augmentation strategy and noise smoothing mechanism to improve the robustness of the proposed method. Besides, to reduce the user's defense overhead, we also propose a novel identity-wise protection mechanism. It can generate a universal perturbation for one speaker and support privacy preservation for speech of any length. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 speech synthesis models, 5 speech verification models, 1 speech recognition model, and 2 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has satisfying privacy-preserving performance, high speech quality, and utility.</p></details> | 2025-08-30 | under review |

However, existing zero-shot TTS models face challenges in capturing the complex correlations between acoustic and semantic features, resulting in a lack of expressiveness and similarity. The primary reason lies in the complex relationship between semantic and acoustic features, which manifests independent and interdependent aspects.This paper introduces a TTS framework that combines both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) modules to harmonize the independence and interdependence of acoustic and semantic information. The AR model leverages the proposed Parallel Tokenizer to synthesize the top semantic and acoustic tokens simultaneously. In contrast, considering the interdependence, the Coupled NAR model predicts detailed tokens based on the general AR model's output. Parallel GPT, built on this architecture, is designed to improve zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis through its parallel structure. Experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the quality and efficiency of the synthesis of existing zero-shot TTS models.

While end-to-end approaches promise theoretical advantages, cascaded systems (CSs) continue to outperform them in language understanding tasks, despite being constrained by sequential processing latency. In this work, we introduce ChipChat, a novel low-latency CS that overcomes traditional bottlenecks through architectural innovations and streaming optimizations. Our system integrates streaming (a) conversational speech recognition with mixture-of-experts, (b) state-action augmented LLM, (c) text-to-speech synthesis, (d) neural vocoder, and (e) speaker modeling. Implemented using MLX, ChipChat achieves sub-second response latency on a Mac Studio without dedicated GPUs, while preserving user privacy through complete on-device processing. Our work shows that strategically redesigned CSs can overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path forward for practical voice-based AI agents.</p></details> | 2025-08-26 | ASRU 2025 |

Existing defenses typically inject noise into human speech to compromise voice encoders in speech synthesis models. However, these methods degrade audio quality and require prior knowledge of the attack approaches, limiting their effectiveness in diverse scenarios. Moreover, real-time audios, such as speech in virtual meetings and voice messages, are still exposed to voice deepfake threats. To overcome these limitations, we propose ClearMask, a noise-free defense mechanism against voice deepfake attacks. Unlike traditional approaches, ClearMask modifies the audio mel-spectrogram by selectively filtering certain frequencies, inducing a transferable voice feature loss without injecting noise. We then apply audio style transfer to further deceive voice decoders while preserving perceived sound quality. Finally, optimized reverberation is introduced to disrupt the output of voice generation models without affecting the naturalness of the speech. Additionally, we develop LiveMask to protect streaming speech in real-time through a universal frequency filter and reverberation generator. Our experimental results show that ClearMask and LiveMask effectively prevent voice deepfake attacks from deceiving speaker verification models and human listeners, even for unseen voice synthesis models and black-box API services. Furthermore, ClearMask demonstrates resilience against adaptive attackers who attempt to recover the original audio signal from the protected speech samples.</p></details> | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, Accepted by AsiaCCS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume, and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2% F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural French speech.

In this paper, we propose a Code-Switched Large Language Model (CS-LLM) to enhance the code-switched text-to-speech synthesis (CS TTS) capability in LLMs with only monolingual corpora. Specifically, we begin by enhancing the multilingual speech processing ability of LLMs through multilingual speech recognition and synthesis tasks. Then, we develop an effective code-switched (CS) data construction strategy that splits and concatenates words from different monolingual speech corpora to equip LLMs with improved CS TTS ability. Experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines in CS TTS in terms of naturalness, speaker consistency and similarity even with limited data. Additionally, the constructed CS data further improves multilingual speech synthesis and recognition.</p></details> | 2025-08-22 | Accepted to ASRU2025 |

These methods overlook the contextual coherence of paragraphs, leading to reduced naturalness and inconsistencies in style and timbre across the long-form speech. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware Memory (CAM)-based long-context Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. The CAM block integrates and retrieves both long-term memory and local context details, enabling dynamic memory updates and transfers within long paragraphs to guide sentence-level speech synthesis. Furthermore, the prefix mask enhances the in-context learning ability by enabling bidirectional attention on prefix tokens while maintaining unidirectional generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art long-context methods in terms of prosody expressiveness, coherence and context inference cost across paragraph-level speech.</p></details> | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech25</p></details> |

Although deep learning methods have achieved high-quality results, their computational cost limits their feasibility on embedded platforms. This work presents an efficient end-to-end SE framework that leverages a Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) vocoder for high-quality speech synthesis. First, a compact neural network predicts enhanced acoustic features from noisy speech: spectral envelope, fundamental frequency (F0), and periodicity. These features are fed into the DDSP vocoder to synthesize the enhanced waveform. The system is trained end-to-end with STFT and adversarial losses, enabling direct optimization at the feature and waveform levels. Experimental results show that our method improves intelligibility and quality by 4% (STOI) and 19% (DNSMOS) over strong baselines without significantly increasing computation, making it well-suited for real-time applications.</p></details> | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and

To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot, multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale synthetic Tibetan speech corpus generated by FMSD-TTS, and (3) an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized assessment of speaker similarity, dialect consistency, and audio quality.</p></details> | 2025-08-20 | 18 pages |

However, synthesizing sarcastic speech remains a challenge due to the nuanced prosody that characterizes sarcasm, as well as the limited availability of annotated sarcastic speech data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel approach that integrates feedback loss from a bi-modal sarcasm detection model into the TTS training process, enhancing the model's ability to capture and convey sarcasm. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning, a speech synthesis model pre-trained on read speech undergoes a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, it is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset encompassing various speech styles, including sarcastic speech. In the second stage, the model is further refined using a dataset focused specifically on sarcastic speech, enhancing its ability to generate sarcasm-aware speech. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the quality, naturalness, and sarcasm-awareness of synthesized speech.</p></details> | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Speec...</summary><p>Speech Synthesis Workshop 2025</p></details> |

| **[Continuous-Token Diffusion for Speaker-Referenced TTS in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12995v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified architectures in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have shown promise in handling diverse tasks within a single framework. In the text-to-speech (TTS) task, current MLLM-based approaches rely on discrete token representations, which disregard the inherently continuous nature of speech and can lead to loss of fine-grained acoustic information. In this work, we investigate the TTS within the MLLM paradigm using continuous speech representations. We design a dual-head architecture and implement two complementary training strategies for a robust model. (1) A diffusion head generating continuous speech representations is added on the MLLM, which is on frame-level and strictly autoregressive. (2) The original language model head is retained to preserve multitask capability and to control the start and end of speech synthesis. (3) Masked training is employed to address exposure bias in autoregressive decoding. (4) To stabilize optimization, we propose a two-stage scheme where the LM is frozen in the second stage, ensuring the diffusion head learns from a fixed input distribution. Evaluations on LibriSpeech(PC) test-clean show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art autoregressive performance, with a WER of 1.95%, speaker similarity of 0.54, and UTMOS of 4.00. The two-stage training yields a 46% relative WER reduction over the one-stage training baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining autoregressive modeling with continuous-token diffusion, supported by a two-stage training procedure.</p></details> | 2025-10-23 |  |
| **[Vox-Evaluator: Enhancing Stability and Fidelity for Zero-shot TTS with A Multi-Level Evaluator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20210v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), driven by language models, diffusion models and masked generation, have achieved impressive naturalness in speech synthesis. Nevertheless, stability and fidelity remain key challenges, manifesting as mispronunciations, audible noise, and quality degradation. To address these issues, we introduce Vox-Evaluator, a multi-level evaluator designed to guide the correction of erroneous speech segments and preference alignment for TTS systems. It is capable of identifying the temporal boundaries of erroneous segments and providing a holistic quality assessment of the generated speech. Specifically, to refine erroneous segments and enhance the robustness of the zero-shot TTS model, we propose to automatically identify acoustic errors with the evaluator, mask the erroneous segments, and finally regenerate speech conditioning on the correct portions. In addition, the fine-gained information obtained from Vox-Evaluator can guide the preference alignment for TTS model, thereby reducing the bad cases in speech synthesis. Due to the lack of suitable training datasets for the Vox-Evaluator, we also constructed a synthesized text-speech dataset annotated with fine-grained pronunciation errors or audio quality issues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Vox-Evaluator in enhancing the stability and fidelity of TTS systems through the speech correction mechanism and preference optimization. The demos are shown.</p></details> | 2025-10-23 | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, due to its tendency to significantly increase TT ranks, the Hadamard product poses a major computational challenge in TT tensor-based algorithms. To address this, it is crucial to develop recompression algorithms that mitigate the effects of this rank increase. Existing recompression algorithms require an explicit representation of the Hadamard product, resulting in high computational and storage costs. In this work, we propose a Hadamard avoiding TT recompression (HaTT) algorithm, which reduces both computational complexity and storage requirements. By leveraging the structure of the Hadamard product in TT tensors and exploiting its Hadamard product-free property, the HaTT algorithm achieves significantly lower complexity compared to existing TT recompression methods. This is confirmed through both complexity analysis and numerical experiments. Furthermore, the HaTT algorithm is applied to solve the Allen--Cahn equation, achieving substantial speedup over existing TT recompression algorithms without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Mismatch Aware Guidance for Robust Emotion Control in Auto-Regressive TTS Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13293v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech, undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and intelligibility.</p></details> | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

This process of cross-lingual emotional speech synthesis presents a complex challenge, necessitating flexible control over emotion, timbre, and language. However, emotion and timbre are highly entangled in speech signals, making fine-grained control challenging. To address this issue, we propose EMM-TTS, a novel two-stage cross-lingual emotional speech synthesis framework based on perturbed self-supervised learning (SSL) representations. In the first stage, the model explicitly and implicitly encodes prosodic cues to capture emotional expressiveness, while the second stage restores the timbre from perturbed SSL representations. We further investigate the effect of different speaker perturbation strategies-formant shifting and speaker anonymization-on the disentanglement of emotion and timbre. To strengthen speaker preservation and expressive control, we introduce Speaker Consistency Loss (SCL) and Speaker-Emotion Adaptive Layer Normalization (SEALN) modules. Additionally, we find that incorporating explicit acoustic features (e.g., F0, energy, and duration) alongside pretrained latent features improves voice cloning performance. Comprehensive multi-metric evaluations, including both subjective and objective measures, demonstrate that EMM-TTS achieves superior naturalness, emotion transferability, and timbre consistency across languages.</p></details> | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Expert Systems with Applications,11 pages</p></details> |

Moreover, we further investigate how emphasis placement modulates fine-grained emotion intensity.

| **[Speak, Edit, Repeat: High-Fidelity Voice Editing and Zero-Shot TTS with Cross-Attentive Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04738v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MAVE (Mamba with Cross-Attention for Voice Editing and Synthesis), a novel autoregressive architecture for text-conditioned voice editing and high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, built on a cross-attentive Mamba backbone. MAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech editing and very competitive results in zero-shot TTS, while not being explicitly trained on the latter task, outperforming leading autoregressive and diffusion models on diverse, real-world audio. By integrating Mamba for efficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise text-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with exceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations on a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2% of listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original, while 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the majority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source. MAVE compares favorably with VoiceCraft and FluentSpeech both on pairwise comparisons and standalone mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations. For zero-shot TTS, MAVE exceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without requiring multiple inference runs or post-processing. Remarkably, these quality gains come with a significantly lower memory cost and approximately the same latency: MAVE requires ~6x less memory than VoiceCraft during inference on utterances from the RealEdit database (mean duration: 6.21s, A100, FP16, batch size 1). Our results demonstrate that MAVE establishes a new standard for flexible, high-fidelity voice editing and synthesis through the synergistic integration of structured state-space modeling and cross-modal attention.</p></details> | 2025-10-06 |  |
| **[UniVoice: Unifying Autoregressive ASR and Flow-Matching based TTS with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04593v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems, gradually becoming the mainstream approach. However, most current approaches address these tasks separately rather than through a unified framework. This work aims to integrate these two tasks into one unified model. Although discrete speech tokenization enables joint modeling, its inherent information loss limits performance in both recognition and generation. In this work, we present UniVoice, a unified LLM framework through continuous representations that seamlessly integrates speech recognition and synthesis within a single model. Our approach combines the strengths of autoregressive modeling for speech recognition with flow matching for high-quality generation. To mitigate the inherent divergence between autoregressive and flow-matching models, we further design a dual attention mechanism, which switches between a causal mask for recognition and a bidirectional attention mask for synthesis. Furthermore, the proposed text-prefix-conditioned speech infilling method enables high-fidelity zero-shot voice cloning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve or exceed current single-task modeling methods in both ASR and zero-shot TTS tasks. This work explores new possibilities for end-to-end speech understanding and generation.</p></details> | 2025-10-06 |  |
| **[VoxCPM: Tokenizer-Free TTS for Context-Aware Speech Generation and True-to-Life Voice Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24650v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for speech synthesis face a fundamental trade-off: discrete tokens ensure stability but sacrifice expressivity, while continuous signals retain acoustic richness but suffer from error accumulation due to task entanglement. This challenge has driven the field towards multi-stage pipelines that rely on pre-trained speech tokenizers, but these create a semantic-acoustic divide, limiting holistic and expressive speech generation. We resolve these dilemma through hierarchical semantic-acoustic modeling with semi-discrete residual representations and present a novel tokenizer-free TTS model VoxCPM. Our framework introduces a differentiable quantization bottleneck that induces natural specialization: a Text-Semantic Language Model (TSLM) generates semantic-prosodic plans, while a Residual Acoustic Model (RALM) recovers fine-grained acoustic details. This hierarchical semantic-acoustic representation guides a local diffusion-based decoder to generate high-fidelity speech latents. Critically, the entire architecture is trained end-to-end under a simple diffusion objective, eliminating dependency on external speech tokenizers. Trained on a massive 1.8 million hours of bilingual corpus, our VoxCPM-0.5B model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS performance among open-source systems, demonstrating that our approach delivers expressive and stable synthesis. Besides, VoxCPM shows the capability to comprehend text to infer and generate appropriate prosody and style, delivering speech with context-aware expressiveness and natural flow. To facilitate community-driven research and development, VoxCPM is publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 | Technical Report |

Recent LLM-TTS systems achieve strong controllability and zero-shot generalization, but their large parameter counts and high latency limit real-world deployment. SPADE addresses this by combining (i) a pruning step guided by a word-error-rate-based layer importance index to remove non-essential Transformer layers, with (ii) multi-level knowledge distillation to restore autoregressive coherence. On zero-shot benchmarks, SPADE preserves near-parity perceptual quality while halving Transformer depth, reducing VRAM usage by up to 20%, and achieving up to 1.7x faster real-time factor with less than 5% of the original training data. These results show that compact LLM-TTS models can maintain naturalness and speaker similarity while enabling practical real-time speech generation.

In contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts. We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens. Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages, substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Facilitating Personalized TTS for Dysarthric Speakers Using Knowledge Anchoring and Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10412v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dysarthric speakers experience substantial communication challenges due to impaired motor control of the speech apparatus, which leads to reduced speech intelligibility. This creates significant obstacles in dataset curation since actual recording of long, articulate sentences for the objective of training personalized TTS models becomes infeasible. Thus, the limited availability of audio data, in addition to the articulation errors that are present within the audio, complicates personalized speech synthesis for target dysarthric speaker adaptation. To address this, we frame the issue as a domain transfer task and introduce a knowledge anchoring framework that leverages a teacher-student model, enhanced by curriculum learning through audio augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model effectively generates synthetic speech with markedly reduced articulation errors and high speaker fidelity, while maintaining prosodic naturalness.</p></details> | 2025-09-25 | Interspeech 2025 |

To address these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable, open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.</p></details> | 2025-09-25 | 5 pages, 2 figures |

First, we analyzed the alignment mechanism between text tokens and speech tokens in LLMs. We then proposed a metric termed the Optimal Alignment Score (OAS), which employs the Viterbi algorithm to evaluate text-speech alignment quality. Subsequently, OAS was integrated into the training of CosyVoice2 to assist LLMs in learning continuous, stable alignment. Additionally, the pre-trained attention value is employed to guide the training of the student CosyVoice2 via chain-of-thought (CoT), which further reduces stability hallucinations in synthesized speech. Experiments on the Seed-TTS-Eval and CV3-Eval test sets demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the stability hallucinations of CosyVoice2 without introducing additional negative effects.

| **[HD-PPT: Hierarchical Decoding of Content- and Prompt-Preference Tokens for Instruction-based TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19001v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have already reached a high degree of naturalness. However, the precision control of TTS inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced LLM performance in text-based tasks, its application to ASR and TTS remains underexplored due to the complexity of training audio-based models. In this study, we propose a lightweight RL framework tailored for audio-based LLMs that can process audio inputs and generate audio outputs. Based on this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve improved performance. Our experiments demonstrate that RL can significantly enhance the performance of both ASR and TTS systems, even with limited training data and a small number of optimization steps.</p></details> | 2025-09-23 |  |
| **[No Verifiable Reward for Prosody: Toward Preference-Guided Prosody Learning in TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18531v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work reports gains in neural text-to-speech (TTS) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, in the absence of a verifiable reward for \textit{prosody}, GRPO trained on transcription-oriented signals (CER/NLL) lowers error rates yet collapses prosody into monotone, unnatural speech; adding speaker-similarity further destabilizes training and degrades CER. We address this with an \textit{iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)} scheme that uses only a few hundred human-labeled preference pairs per round to directly optimize prosodic naturalness while regularizing to the current model. On \textbf{KoCC-TTS}, a curated dataset of authentic Korean call center interactions capturing task-oriented dialogues, our method attains the highest human preference (ELO) with competitive CER, outperforming GRPO and strong commercial baselines. These results suggest that when prosody cannot be rewarded automatically, \textit{human preference optimization} offers a practical and data-efficient path to natural and robust TTS.

| **[Bridging the gap between training and inference in LM-based TTS models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17021v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) have shown that language model (LM) based systems offer competitive performance compared to traditional approaches. However, in training, TTS models use ground-truth (GT) tokens as prefixes to predict the next token, while in inference these tokens are not available, a gap between training and inference that is often neglected. In this study, we propose a prompt-guided hybrid training scheme to mitigate exposure bias in popular LM-based TTS systems. Our core idea is to adopt a hybrid training paradigm that combines teacher forcing with free running, thereby introducing self-generated tokens into the training process. This makes the training mode more consistent with inference, reducing the training-inference gap. In addition, we incorporate an EOS prediction mechanism during training to detect incorrect sequence termination and adaptively control the free running process. Experimental results provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of exposure bias on LM-based TTS, and demonstrate that our method effectively narrows the training-inference gap, thereby improving the quality of synthesized long-form speech.</p></details> | 2025-09-21 | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Existing DiT-based text-to-speech (TTS) model acceleration approaches mainly focus on reducing sampling steps through distillation techniques, yet they remain constrained by training costs. We introduce DiTReducio, a training-free acceleration framework that compresses computations in DiT-based TTS models via progressive calibration. We propose two compression methods, Temporal Skipping and Branch Skipping, to eliminate redundant computations during inference. Moreover, based on two characteristic attention patterns identified within DiT layers, we devise a pattern-guided strategy to selectively apply the compression methods. Our method allows flexible modulation between generation quality and computational efficiency through adjustable compression thresholds. Experimental evaluations conducted on F5-TTS and MegaTTS 3 demonstrate that DiTReducio achieves a 75.4% reduction in FLOPs and improves the Real-Time Factor (RTF) by 37.1%, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> | 2025-09-11 |  |

LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.</p></details> | 2025-09-06 |  |

Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.</p></details> | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference (Oral)</p></details> |

We use duration differences between American English tense (longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS. Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer (at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably, listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for these individuals.</p></details> | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop, 2025, Project webpage

However, challenges such as limited data and the lack of fine-grained, adaptive feature selection often hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose MoTAS, a robust framework designed to enhance AD screening efficiency. MoTAS leverages Text-to-Speech (TTS) augmentation to increase data volume and employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to improve multimodal feature selection, jointly enhancing model generalization. The process begins with automatic speech recognition (ASR) to obtain accurate transcriptions. TTS is then used to synthesize speech that enriches the dataset. After extracting acoustic and text embeddings, the MoE mechanism dynamically selects the most informative features, optimizing feature fusion for improved classification. Evaluated on the ADReSSo dataset, MoTAS achieves a leading accuracy of 85.71\%, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of TTS augmentation and MoE in boosting classification performance. These findings highlight the practical value of MoTAS in real-world AD screening scenarios, particularly in data-limited settings.</p></details> | 2025-08-28 |  |
| **[Your Reward Function for RL is Your Best PRM for Search: Unifying RL and Search-Based TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14313v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.</p></details> | 2025-08-22 |  |

This paper investigates the potential of integrating visual context to enhance prosody prediction.

However, in real-world applications, the diverse range of user-generated descriptions inevitably introduces numerous out-of-domain inputs that challenge the text understanding capabilities of these systems. To address this issue, we propose MoE-TTS, a description-based TTS model designed to enhance the understanding of out-of-domain text descriptions. MoE-TTS employs a modality-based mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach to augment a pre-trained textual large language model (LLM) with a set of specialized weights adapted to the speech modality while maintaining the original LLM frozen during training. This approach allows MoE-TTS to effectively leverage the pre-trained knowledge and text understanding abilities of textual LLMs. Our experimental results indicate that: first, even the most advanced closed-source commercial products can be challenged by carefully designed out-of-domain description test sets; second, MoE-TTS achieves superior performance in generating speech that more accurately reflects the descriptions.

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech technologies.</p></details> | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models struggle with zero-shot transcription of dysarthric speech, yielding high error rates. To improve performance with limited real dysarthric data, we fine-tune an ASR model using synthetic speech generated via a personalized text-to-speech (TTS) system. We introduce a method for generating synthetic dysarthric speech with controlled severity by leveraging premorbidity recordings of the given speaker and speaker embedding interpolation, enabling ASR fine-tuning on a continuum of impairments. Fine-tuning on both real and synthetic dysarthric speech reduces the character error rate (CER) from 36-51% (zero-shot) to 7.3%. Our monolingual FastConformer_Hu ASR model significantly outperforms Whisper-turbo when fine-tuned on the same data, and the inclusion of synthetic speech contributes to an 18% relative CER reduction. These results highlight the potential of personalized ASR systems for improving accessibility for individuals with severe speech impairments.</p></details> | 2025-08-08 |  |

We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap.

To further enhance prosody and naturalness, we employ a cross-attention based duration prediction mechanism that utilizes reference audio, enabling more accurate and speaker consistent timing. This results in speech that closely resembles the target speaker while improving duration modeling and overall expressiveness. Additionally, to improve zero-shot generation, we employed classifier free guidance, allowing the system to generate speech more near speech for unknown speakers. Using this approach, we trained language-specific speaker-conditioned models.

| **[Differentiable Reward Optimization for LLM based TTS system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05911v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) method aimed at enhancing the performance of neural codec language models based text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In contrast to conventional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | 2025-07-08 |  |

The dataset consists of 4,326 audio samples from 52 different TTS systems and human voices and is, up to our knowledge, the first of its kind in Spanish. To label the audios, a subjective test was designed based on the ITU-T Rec. P.807 standard and completed by 92 participants. Furthermore, the utility of the collected dataset was validated by training automatic naturalness prediction systems. We explored two approaches: fine-tuning an existing model originally trained for English, and training small downstream networks on top of frozen self-supervised speech models. Our models achieve a mean absolute error of 0.8 on a five-point MOS scale. Further analysis demonstrates the quality and diversity of the developed dataset, and its potential to advance TTS research in Spanish.</p></details> | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Multi-interaction TTS toward professional recording reproduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00808v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthesized speech. Our approach models the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed model with its corresponding dataset enables iterative style refinements in accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction capability.

| **[An Exploration of ECAPA-TDNN and x-vector Speaker Representations in Zero-shot Multi-speaker TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20190v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) systems rely on speaker embeddings to synthesize speech in the voice of an unseen speaker, using only a short reference utterance. While many speaker embeddings have been developed for speaker recognition, their relative effectiveness in zero-shot TTS remains underexplored. In this work, we employ a YourTTS-based TTS system to compare three different speaker encoders - YourTTS's original H/ASP encoder, x-vector embeddings, and ECAPA-TDNN embeddings - within an otherwise fixed zero-shot TTS framework. All models were trained on the same dataset of Czech read speech and evaluated on 24 out-of-domain target speakers using both subjective and objective methods. The subjective evaluation was conducted via a listening test focused on speaker similarity, while the objective evaluation measured cosine distances between speaker embeddings extracted from synthesized and real utterances. Across both evaluations, the original H/ASP encoder consistently outperformed the alternatives, with ECAPA-TDNN showing better results than x-vectors. These findings suggest that, despite the popularity of ECAPA-TDNN in speaker recognition, it does not necessarily offer improvements for speaker similarity in zero-shot TTS in this configuration. Our study highlights the importance of empirical evaluation when reusing speaker recognition embeddings in TTS and provides a framework for additional future comparisons.</p></details> | 2025-06-25 | Accepted to TSD 2025 |

Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with high acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits scalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent studies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they often overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS models to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality yet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a data-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1) automated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic selection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3) evaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean opinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance. Furthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a closed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data cleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model. Extensive experiments on Japanese YouTube data demonstrate that TTSOps outperforms conventional acoustic-quality-based baselines in both the naturalness and speaker diversity of synthesized speech.</p></details> | 2025-06-18 |  |
| **[A Self-Refining Framework for Enhancing ASR Using TTS-Synthesized Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11130v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings.</p></details> | 2025-06-16 |  |

Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization. Audio examples are available on our demo page (https://ntt-hilab-gensp.github.io/is2025voiceimpression/).</p></details> | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,5 figures, Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model, with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the voice reconstruction task.</p></details> | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

India has 1369 languages, with 22 official using 13 scripts. Training a TTS system for all these languages, most of which have no digital resources, seems a Herculean task. Our work focuses on zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for Sanskrit, Maharashtrian and Canara Konkani, Maithili and Kurukh by leveraging linguistic connections across languages with suitable synthesisers. Evaluations confirm the effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its potential to expand speech technology access for under-represented languages.</p></details> | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often depend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity for post-hoc adjustments. Similarly, traditional mispronunciation correction relies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in low-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation. Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features and corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens the door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining, bridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

VoiceStar is an autoregressive encoder-decoder neural codec language model, that leverages a novel Progress-Monitoring Rotary Position Embedding (PM-RoPE) and is trained with Continuation-Prompt Mixed (CPM) training. PM-RoPE enables the model to better align text and speech tokens, indicates the target duration for the generated speech, and also allows the model to generate speech waveforms much longer in duration than those seen during. CPM training also helps to mitigate the training/inference mismatch, and significantly improves the quality of the generated speech in terms of speaker similarity and intelligibility. VoiceStar outperforms or is on par with current state-of-the-art models on short-form benchmarks such as Librispeech and Seed-TTS, and significantly outperforms these models on long-form/extrapolation benchmarks (20-50s) in terms of intelligibility and naturalness.

Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions. Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation, making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645 diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems, such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval, demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences. Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment and a high correlation with human preferences.

This semantic and hierarchical encoding strategy provides a robust and rich style representation for an acoustic model.

Additionally, we explore the potential of GSA in terms of interpretability and controllability, which stems from its hierarchical structure.</p></details> | 2025-05-26 | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[UniTTS: An end-to-end TTS system without decoupling of acoustic and semantic information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17426v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multi-codebook neutral audio codecs such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) and Group Vector Quantization (GVQ) has significantly advanced Large-Language-Model (LLM) based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. These codecs are crucial in separating semantic and acoustic information while efficiently harnessing semantic priors. However, since semantic and acoustic information cannot be fully aligned, a significant drawback of these methods when applied to LLM-based TTS is that large language models may have limited access to comprehensive audio information. To address this limitation, we propose DistilCodec and UniTTS, which collectively offer the following advantages: 1) This method can distill a multi-codebook audio codec into a single-codebook audio codec with 32,768 codes while achieving a near 100\% utilization. 2) As DistilCodec does not employ a semantic alignment scheme, a large amount of high-quality unlabeled audio (such as audiobooks with sound effects, songs, etc.) can be incorporated during training, further expanding data diversity and broadening its applicability. 3) Leveraging the comprehensive audio information modeling of DistilCodec, we integrated three key tasks into UniTTS's pre-training framework: audio modality autoregression, text modality autoregression, and speech-text cross-modal autoregression. This allows UniTTS to accept interleaved text and speech/audio prompts while substantially preserving LLM's text capabilities. 4) UniTTS employs a three-stage training process: Pre-Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Alignment.

In this paper, we propose a novel neural codec-based speech denoiser and integrate it with the advanced LLM-based TTS model, LauraTTS, to achieve noise-robust zero-shot TTS. The proposed codec denoiser consists of an audio codec, a token denoiser, and an embedding refiner. The token denoiser predicts the first two groups of clean acoustic tokens from the noisy ones, which can serve as the acoustic prompt for LauraTTS to synthesize high-quality personalized speech or be converted to clean speech waveforms through the embedding refiner and codec decoder. Experimental results show that our proposed codec denoiser outperforms state-of-the-art speech enhancement (SE) methods, and the proposed noise-robust LauraTTS surpasses the approach using additional SE models.</p></details> | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional MoE approaches, which face substantial computational overhead as expert counts grow, TT-LoRA MoE decomposes training into two distinct, optimized stages. First, we independently train lightweight, tensorized low-rank adapters (TT-LoRA experts), each specialized for specific tasks. Subsequently, these expert adapters remain frozen, eliminating inter-task interference and catastrophic forgetting in multi-task setting. A sparse MoE router, trained separately, dynamically leverages base model representations to select exactly one specialized adapter per input at inference time, automating expert selection without explicit task specification. Comprehensive experiments confirm our architecture retains the memory efficiency of low-rank adapters, seamlessly scales to large expert pools, and achieves robust task-level optimization. This structured decoupling significantly enhances computational efficiency and flexibility: uses only 2% of LoRA, 0.3% of Adapters and 0.03% of AdapterFusion parameters and outperforms AdapterFusion by 4 value in multi-tasking, enabling practical and scalable multi-task inference deployments.</p></details> | 2025-04-29 |  |

SPSS and USEL offer low latency and low disk footprint at the expense of naturalness and audio quality. Cloud-based neural TTS systems provide significantly better audio quality and naturalness but regress in terms of latency and responsiveness, rendering these impractical for real-world applications. More recently, neural TTS models were made deployable to run on handheld devices. Nevertheless, latency remains higher than SPSS and USEL, while disk footprint prohibits pre-installation for multiple voices at once. In this work, we describe a high-quality compact neural TTS system achieving latency on the order of 15 ms with low disk footprint.

| **[TouchTTS: An Embarrassingly Simple TTS Framework that Everyone Can Touch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08237v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that LLM-based systems are data-hungry. Recent LLM-based TTS works typically employ complex data processing pipelines to obtain high-quality training data. These sophisticated pipelines require excellent models at each stage (e.g., speech denoising, speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and punctuation models), which themselves demand high-quality training data and are rarely open-sourced. Even with state-of-the-art models, issues persist, such as incomplete background noise removal and misalignment between punctuation and actual speech pauses. Moreover, the stringent filtering strategies often retain only 10-30\% of the original data, significantly impeding data scaling efforts. In this work, we leverage a noise-robust audio tokenizer (S3Tokenizer) to design a simplified yet effective TTS data processing pipeline that maintains data quality while substantially reducing data acquisition costs, achieving a data retention rate of over 50\%. Beyond data scaling challenges, LLM-based TTS systems also incur higher deployment costs compared to conventional approaches. Current systems typically use LLMs solely for text-to-token generation, while requiring separate models (e.g., flow matching models) for token-to-waveform generation, which cannot be directly executed by LLM inference engines, further complicating deployment. To address these challenges, we eliminate redundant modules in both LLM and flow components, replacing the flow model backbone with an LLM architecture. Building upon this simplified flow backbone, we propose a unified architecture for both streaming and non-streaming inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Finally, we explore the feasibility of unifying TTS and ASR tasks using the same data for training, thanks to the simplified pipeline and the S3Tokenizer that reduces the quality requirements for TTS training data.</p></details> | 2024-12-12 | Technical Report |
| **[Hard-Synth: Synthesizing Diverse Hard Samples for ASR using Zero-Shot TTS and LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13159v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-speech (TTS) models have been widely adopted to enhance automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using text-only corpora, thereby reducing the cost of labeling real speech data. Existing research primarily utilizes additional text data and predefined speech styles supported by TTS models. In this paper, we propose Hard-Synth, a novel ASR data augmentation method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and advanced zero-shot TTS. Our approach employs LLMs to generate diverse in-domain text through rewriting, without relying on additional text data. Rather than using predefined speech styles, we introduce a hard prompt selection method with zero-shot TTS to clone speech styles that the ASR model finds challenging to recognize. Experiments demonstrate that Hard-Synth significantly enhances the Conformer model, achieving relative word error rate (WER) reductions of 6.5\%/4.4\% on LibriSpeech dev/test-other subsets. Additionally, we show that Hard-Synth is data-efficient and capable of reducing bias in ASR.</p></details> | 2024-11-20 |  |
| **[Obstruction characterization of co-TT graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12614v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Threshold tolerance graphs and their complement graphs, known as co-TT graphs, were introduced by Monma, Reed, and Trotter[24]. Building on this, Hell et al.[19] introduced the concept of negative interval. Then they proceeded to define signedinterval digraphs/ bigraphs, demonstrating their equivalence to several seemingly distinct classes of digraphs/ bigraphs. They also showed that co-TT graphs are equivalent to symmetric signed-interval digraphs, where some vertices of the digraphs have loops and others do not. We have showed that this actually solve the representation characterization problem of co-TT graphs posed by Monma, Reed and Trotter [24]. In this paper, we characterize signed-interval bigraphs and signed-interval graphs in terms of their biadjacency matrices and adjacency matrices, respectively. Moreover we emphasize on the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, i.e. co-TT graphs. Finally, by utilizing the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, we resolve the open problem of characterizing co-TT graphs in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs, a problem initially posed by Monma, Reed, and Trotter in the same paper.</p></details> | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2206.05917</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing TTS Stability in Hebrew using Discrete Semantic Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21502v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a refined approach to Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation that significantly enhances sampling stability across languages, with a particular focus on Hebrew. By leveraging discrete semantic units with higher phonetic correlation obtained from a self-supervised model, our method addresses the inherent instability often encountered in TTS systems, especially those dealing with non-diacriticized scripts like Hebrew. Utilizing HuBERT codes, our model generates discrete representations that are optimized for TTS tasks, thereby reducing the dependency on diacritic-based text processing. This advancement not only simplifies the language modeling process but also improves the robustness and shows controllability of the speech output due to disentenglement properties of the semantic units. The inclusion of a speaker embedding in the vocoder further aids in capturing the unique vocal characteristics of the speaker, contributing to the naturalness of the synthesized speech. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only maintains high performance in Hebrew but also shows adaptability to English, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing stability in TTS systems universally. Our method, named LOTHM (Language of The Hebrew Man), outperforms existing methods in terms of stability while achieving naturalness and speaker similarity on par with previous methods, making it a compelling choice for future speech synthesis applications.

| **[ELAICHI: Enhancing Low-resource TTS by Addressing Infrequent and Low-frequency Character Bigrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17901v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology have led to natural-sounding speech for English, primarily due to the availability of large-scale, high-quality web data. However, many other languages lack access to such resources, relying instead on limited studio-quality data. This scarcity results in synthesized speech that often suffers from intelligibility issues, particularly with low-frequency character bigrams. In this paper, we propose three solutions to address this challenge. First, we leverage high-quality data from linguistically or geographically related languages to improve TTS for the target language. Second, we utilize low-quality Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) data recorded in non-studio environments, which is refined using denoising and speech enhancement models. Third, we apply knowledge distillation from large-scale models using synthetic data to generate more robust outputs. Our experiments with Hindi demonstrate significant reductions in intelligibility issues, as validated by human evaluators. We propose this methodology as a viable alternative for languages with limited access to high-quality data, enabling them to collectively benefit from shared resources.</p></details> | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

With the advent of versatile and powerful text-to-speech (TTS) models, capable of generating speech with human-level naturalness, expressiveness, and diverse speaker profiles, leveraging TTS for ASR data augmentation provides a cost-effective and practical approach to enhancing ASR performance. Comprehensive experiments on an unprecedentedly rich variety of low-resource datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial performance improvements, proving that the proposed method of enhancing low-resource ASR through a versatile TTS model is highly effective and has broad application prospects. Furthermore, we delve deeper into key characteristics of synthesized speech data that contribute to ASR improvement, examining factors such as text diversity, speaker diversity, and the volume of synthesized data, with text diversity being studied for the first time in this work. We hope our findings provide helpful guidance and reference for the practical application of TTS-based data augmentation and push the advancement of low-resource ASR one step further.</p></details> | 2024-10-22 |  |

However, such data is scarce for Indian languages due to the lack of high-quality, manually subtitled data on platforms like LibriVox or YouTube. To address this gap, we enhance existing large-scale ASR datasets containing natural conversations collected in low-quality environments to generate high-quality TTS training data. Our pipeline leverages the cross-lingual generalization of denoising and speech enhancement models trained on English and applied to Indian languages. This results in IndicVoices-R (IV-R), the largest multilingual Indian TTS dataset derived from an ASR dataset, with 1,704 hours of high-quality speech from 10,496 speakers across 22 Indian languages. IV-R matches the quality of gold-standard TTS datasets like LJSpeech, LibriTTS, and IndicTTS. We also introduce the IV-R Benchmark, the first to assess zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot speaker generalization capabilities of TTS models on Indian voices, ensuring diversity in age, gender, and style. We demonstrate that fine-tuning an English pre-trained model on a combined dataset of high-quality IndicTTS and our IV-R dataset results in better zero-shot speaker generalization compared to fine-tuning on the IndicTTS dataset alone. Further, our evaluation reveals limited zero-shot generalization for Indian voices in TTS models trained on prior datasets, which we improve by fine-tuning the model on our data containing diverse set of speakers across language families. We open-source all data and code, releasing the first TTS model for all 22 official Indian languages.</p></details> | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks track</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised TTS Acoustic Modeling for TTS with Conditional Disentangled Sequential VAE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02512v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised text-to-speech acoustic model training scheme, named UTTS, which does not require text-audio pairs. UTTS is a multi-speaker speech synthesizer that supports zero-shot voice cloning, it is developed from a perspective of disentangled speech representation learning. The framework offers a flexible choice of a speaker's duration model, timbre feature (identity) and content for TTS inference. We leverage recent advancements in self-supervised speech representation learning as well as speech synthesis front-end techniques for system development. Specifically, we employ our recently formulated Conditional Disentangled Sequential Variational Auto-encoder (C-DSVAE) as the backbone UTTS AM, which offers well-structured content representations given unsupervised alignment (UA) as condition during training. For UTTS inference, we utilize a lexicon to map input text to the phoneme sequence, which is expanded to the frame-level forced alignment (FA) with a speaker-dependent duration model. Then, we develop an alignment mapping module that converts FA to UA. Finally, the C-DSVAE, serving as the self-supervised TTS AM, takes the predicted UA and a target speaker embedding to generate the mel spectrogram, which is ultimately converted to waveform with a neural vocoder. We show how our method enables speech synthesis without using a paired TTS corpus in AM development stage. Experiments demonstrate that UTTS can synthesize speech of high naturalness and intelligibility measured by human and objective evaluations.

| **[Exploring synthetic data for cross-speaker style transfer in style representation based TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17364v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating cross-speaker style transfer in text-to-speech (TTS) models is challenging due to the need to disentangle speaker and style information in audio. In low-resource expressive data scenarios, voice conversion (VC) can generate expressive speech for target speakers, which can then be used to train the TTS model. However, the quality and style transfer ability of the VC model are crucial for the overall TTS model quality. In this work, we explore the use of synthetic data generated by a VC model to assist the TTS model in cross-speaker style transfer tasks. Additionally, we employ pre-training of the style encoder using timbre perturbation and prototypical angular loss to mitigate speaker leakage. Our results show that using VC synthetic data can improve the naturalness and speaker similarity of TTS in cross-speaker scenarios. Furthermore, we extend this approach to a cross-language scenario, enhancing accent transfer.</p></details> | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SynData4GenAI 2024</p></details> |

To address sparse audio-visual-emotional data, the model is trained using LRS3, CREMA-D, and MELD datasets, demonstrating its adaptability. FEIM-TTS's unique capability to produce high-quality, speaker-agnostic speech makes it suitable for creating adaptable voices for virtual characters. Moreover, FEIM-TTS significantly enhances accessibility for individuals with visual impairments or those who have trouble seeing. By integrating emotional nuances into TTS, our model enables dynamic and engaging auditory experiences for webcomics, allowing visually impaired users to enjoy these narratives more fully.

Our proposed VT module comprises a speaker-encoder that processes reference speech, a bottleneck layer, and residual adapters, connected to preexisting TTS layers. We compare the performance of various configurations of these components and report Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Speaker Similarity across languages. Using a single English reference speech per speaker, we achieve an average voice transfer similarity score of 73% across nine target languages. Vocal characteristics contribute significantly to the construction and perception of individual identity. The loss of one's voice, due to physical or neurological conditions, can lead to a profound sense of loss, impacting one's core identity. As a case study, we demonstrate that our approach can not only transfer typical speech but also restore the voices of individuals with dysarthria, even when only atypical speech samples are available - a valuable utility for those who have never had typical speech or banked their voice. Cross-lingual typical audio samples, plus videos demonstrating voice restoration for dysarthric speakers are available here (google.github.io/tacotron/publications/zero_shot_voice_transfer).</p></details> | 2024-09-20 | Submitted to ICASSP |

Further optimization can be achieved through preference alignment algorithms, which adjust LMs to align with the preferences of reward models, enhancing the desirability of the generated content. This study presents a thorough empirical evaluation of how preference alignment algorithms, particularly Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enhance LM-based TTS. With a 1.15B parameter LM-based TTS model, we demonstrate that preference alignment consistently improves intelligibility, speaker similarity, and proxy subjective evaluation scores, with the latter two metrics surpassing even human speech in certain evaluations. We also show preference alignment is applicable to low-resource scenarios and effectively generalized to out-of-domain applications.</p></details> | 2024-09-19 |  |
| **[Towards Developing State-of-the-Art TTS Synthesisers for 13 Indian Languages with Signal Processing aided Alignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17153v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end (E2E) systems synthesise high-quality speech, but this typically requires a large amount of data. As E2E synthesis progressed from Tacotron to FastSpeech2, it became evident that features representing prosody, particularly sub-word durations, are important for error-free synthesis. Variants of FastSpeech use a teacher model or forced alignments for training. This paper uses signal processing cues in tandem with forced alignment to produce accurate phone boundaries for the training data. As a result of better duration modelling, good-quality synthesisers are developed. Evaluations indicate that systems developed using the proposed signal processing-aided approach are better than systems developed using other alignment approaches, especially in low-resource scenarios. Our systems also outperform the existing best TTS systems available for 13 Indian languages.</p></details> | 2024-09-18 | Version 1 uploaded |

Utilizing large amounts of text-to-speech (TTS) synthesized data can reduce the cost and time associated with KWS development. However, TTS data may contain artifacts not present in real speech, which the KWS model can exploit (overfit), leading to degraded accuracy on real speech. To address this issue, we propose applying an adversarial training method to prevent the KWS model from learning TTS-specific features when trained on large amounts of TTS data. Experimental results demonstrate that KWS model accuracy on real speech data can be improved by up to 12% when adversarial loss is used in addition to the original KWS loss. Surprisingly, we also observed that the adversarial setup improves accuracy by up to 8%, even when trained solely on TTS and real negative speech data, without any real positive examples.</p></details> | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in a Workshop at Interspeech 2024, Synthetic Data's

However, the ever-growing complexity of LLMs demands immense computational resources, hindering the broader research and application of these models. To address this, various parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, such as Low-Rank Approximation (LoRA) and Adapters, have been developed. Despite their potential, these methods often face limitations in compressibility. Specifically, LoRA struggles to scale effectively with the increasing number of trainable parameters in modern large scale LLMs. Additionally, Low-Rank Economic Tensor-Train Adaptation (LoRETTA), which utilizes tensor train decomposition, has not yet achieved the level of compression necessary for fine-tuning very large scale models with limited resources. This paper introduces Tensor Train Low-Rank Approximation (TT-LoRA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach that extends LoRETTA with optimized tensor train (TT) decomposition integration. By eliminating Adapters and traditional LoRA-based structures, TT-LoRA achieves greater model compression without compromising downstream task performance, along with reduced inference latency and computational overhead. We conduct an exhaustive parameter search to establish benchmarks that highlight the trade-off between model compression and performance. Our results demonstrate significant compression of LLMs while maintaining comparable performance to larger models, facilitating their deployment on resource-constraint platforms.</p></details> | 2024-08-02 | LA-UR-24-28177 |

Keyword spotting models require a huge amount of training data to be accurate, and obtaining such training data can be costly. In the current state of the art, TTS models can generate large amounts of natural-sounding data, which can help reducing cost and time for KWS model development. Still, TTS generated data can be lacking diversity compared to real data. To pursue maximizing KWS model accuracy under the constraint of limited resources and current TTS capability, we explored various strategies to mix TTS data and real human speech data, with a focus on minimizing real data use and maximizing diversity of TTS output. Our experimental results indicate that relatively small amounts of real audio data with speaker diversity (100 speakers, 2k utterances) and large amounts of TTS synthesized data can achieve reasonably high accuracy (within 3x error rate of baseline), compared to the baseline (trained with 3.8M real positive utterances).</p></details> | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in a Workshop at Interspeech 2024, Synthetic Data's

| **[Enhancing Out-of-Vocabulary Performance of Indian TTS Systems for Practical Applications through Low-Effort Data Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13435v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available TTS datasets for low-resource languages like Hindi and Tamil typically contain 10-20 hours of data, leading to poor vocabulary coverage. This limitation becomes evident in downstream applications where domain-specific vocabulary coupled with frequent code-mixing with English, results in many OOV words. To highlight this problem, we create a benchmark containing OOV words from several real-world applications. Indeed, state-of-the-art Hindi and Tamil TTS systems perform poorly on this OOV benchmark, as indicated by intelligibility tests. To improve the model's OOV performance, we propose a low-effort and economically viable strategy to obtain more training data. Specifically, we propose using volunteers as opposed to high quality voice artists to record words containing character bigrams unseen in the training data. We show that using such inexpensive data, the model's performance improves on OOV words, while not affecting voice quality and in-domain performance.</p></details> | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Language Modeling Approach to Diacritic-Free Hebrew TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12206v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the task of text-to-speech (TTS) in Hebrew. Traditional Hebrew contains Diacritics, which dictate the way individuals should pronounce given words, however, modern Hebrew rarely uses them. The lack of diacritics in modern Hebrew results in readers expected to conclude the correct pronunciation and understand which phonemes to use based on the context. This imposes a fundamental challenge on TTS systems to accurately map between text-to-speech. In this work, we propose to adopt a language modeling Diacritics-Free approach, for the task of Hebrew TTS. The model operates on discrete speech representations and is conditioned on a word-piece tokenizer. We optimize the proposed method using in-the-wild weakly supervised data and compare it to several diacritic-based TTS systems. Results suggest the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines considering both content preservation and naturalness of the generated speech. Samples can be found under the following link: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/HebTTS/</p></details> | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech24</p></details> |

| **[Do Joint Language-Audio Embeddings Encode Perceptual Timbre Semantics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14249v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and modeling the relationship between language and sound is critical for applications such as music information retrieval,text-guided music generation, and audio captioning. Central to these tasks is the use of joint language-audio embedding spaces, which map textual descriptions and auditory content into a shared embedding space. While multimodal embedding models such as MS-CLAP, LAION-CLAP, and MuQ-MuLan have shown strong performance in aligning language and audio, their correspondence to human perception of timbre, a multifaceted attribute encompassing qualities such as brightness, roughness, and warmth, remains underexplored. In this paper, we evaluate the above three joint language-audio embedding models on their ability to capture perceptual dimensions of timbre. Our findings show that LAION-CLAP consistently provides the most reliable alignment with human-perceived timbre semantics across both instrumental sounds and audio effects.</p></details> | 2025-10-16 |  |
| **[Omni-Captioner: Data Pipeline, Models, and Benchmark for Omni Detailed Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12720v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective, we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable, efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such detailed captions.</p></details> | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ddlBoJack/Omni-Captioner</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive vector steering: A training-free, layer-wise intervention for hallucination mitigation in large audio and multimodal models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12851v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Audio-Language Models and Multi-Modal Large Language Models have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks such as Audio Question Answering (AQA), Audio Captioning, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, there is growing evidence that these models can hallucinate about the content of the audio. To address this issue, we probe the models' internal states and propose Adaptive Vector Steering (AVS), a method that better grounds generation in audio content. We also identify a strong correlation between output correctness and internal representations. Experiments show consistent performance gains across two models and two benchmarks. On the Audio Hallucination QA dataset, our method boosts the F1-score of Gemma from 0.550 to 0.619 and Qwen from 0.626 to 0.632. Furthermore, our method increases the accuracy of Qwen on MMAU from 0.548 to 0.592, marking an 8% relative increase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply vector steering to mitigate hallucination in audio.</p></details> | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Note:...</summary><p>Note: This preprint is a version of the paper submitted to ICASSP

| **[Diffusion-Link: Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Bridging the Audio-Text Modality Gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11330v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations, yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results. (1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2) Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and 7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond knowledge-retrieval-centric designs.

| **[AURA Score: A Metric For Holistic Audio Question Answering Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04934v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio Question Answering (AQA) is a key task for evaluating Audio-Language Models (ALMs), yet assessing open-ended responses remains challenging. Existing metrics used for AQA such as BLEU, METEOR and BERTScore, mostly adapted from NLP and audio captioning, rely on surface similarity and fail to account for question context, reasoning, and partial correctness. To address the gap in literature, we make three contributions in this work. First, we introduce AQEval to enable systematic benchmarking of AQA metrics. It is the first benchmark of its kind, consisting of 10k model responses annotated by multiple humans for their correctness and relevance. Second, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing AQA metrics on AQEval, highlighting weak correlation with human judgment, especially for longer answers. Third, we propose a new metric - AURA score, to better evaluate open-ended model responses. On AQEval, AURA achieves state-of-the-art correlation with human ratings, significantly outperforming all baselines. Through this work, we aim to highlight the limitations of current AQA evaluation methods and motivate better metrics. We release both the AQEval benchmark and the AURA metric to support future research in holistic AQA evaluation.</p></details> | 2025-10-06 |  |
| **[Taming Text-to-Sounding Video Generation via Advanced Modality Condition and Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03117v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task, Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer, which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust ``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information, achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions, offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints will be publicly released.</p></details> | 2025-10-03 |  |
| **[When Audio Generators Become Good Listeners: Generative Features for Understanding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24635v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work pioneers the utilization of generative features in enhancing audio understanding. Unlike conventional discriminative features that directly optimize posterior and thus emphasize semantic abstraction while losing fine grained details, audio generation models inherently encode both spatiotemporal perception (capturing local acoustic texture across time and frequency) and semantic prior (knowing what to generate). It motivates us to explore the bridge of these complementary strengths. We provide a systematic investigation of their differences and complementary relationships, and ultimately propose an effective fusion strategy. Experiments across multiple tasks, including sound event classification, tagging, and particularly the fine grained task of audio captioning, demonstrate consistent performance gains. Beyond empirical improvements, this work more importantly introduces a new perspective on audio representation learning, highlighting that generative discriminative complementarity can provide both detailed perception and semantic awareness for audio understanding.</p></details> | 2025-09-29 |  |
| **[CapSpeech: Enabling Downstream Applications in Style-Captioned Text-to-Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02863v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS). However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.</p></details> | 2025-09-26 |  |
| **[From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01659v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.</p></details> | 2025-09-22 |  |

However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.
