| **[Long-Context Speech Synthesis with Context-Aware Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14713v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-text speech synthesis, current approaches typically convert text to speech at the sentence-level and concatenate the results to form pseudo-paragraph-level speech. These methods overlook the contextual coherence of paragraphs, leading to reduced naturalness and inconsistencies in style and timbre across the long-form speech. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware Memory (CAM)-based long-context Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. The CAM block integrates and retrieves both long-term memory and local context details, enabling dynamic memory updates and transfers within long paragraphs to guide sentence-level speech synthesis. Furthermore, the prefix mask enhances the in-context learning ability by enabling bidirectional attention on prefix tokens while maintaining unidirectional generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art long-context methods in terms of prosody expressiveness, coherence and context inference cost across paragraph-level speech.</p></details> | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech25</p></details> |
| **[Improving Resource-Efficient Speech Enhancement via Neural Differentiable DSP Vocoder Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14709v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying speech enhancement (SE) systems in wearable devices, such as smart glasses, is challenging due to the limited computational resources on the device. Although deep learning methods have achieved high-quality results, their computational cost limits their feasibility on embedded platforms. This work presents an efficient end-to-end SE framework that leverages a Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) vocoder for high-quality speech synthesis. First, a compact neural network predicts enhanced acoustic features from noisy speech: spectral envelope, fundamental frequency (F0), and periodicity. These features are fed into the DDSP vocoder to synthesize the enhanced waveform. The system is trained end-to-end with STFT and adversarial losses, enabling direct optimization at the feature and waveform levels. Experimental results show that our method improves intelligibility and quality by 4% (STOI) and 19% (DNSMOS) over strong baselines without significantly increasing computation, making it well-suited for real-time applications.</p></details> | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and

| **[FMSD-TTS: Few-shot Multi-Speaker Multi-Dialect Text-to-Speech Synthesis for Ãœ-Tsang, Amdo and Kham Speech Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14351v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tibetan is a low-resource language with minimal parallel speech corpora spanning its three major dialects-\"U-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham-limiting progress in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot, multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale synthetic Tibetan speech corpus generated by FMSD-TTS, and (3) an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized assessment of speaker similarity, dialect consistency, and audio quality.</p></details> | 2025-08-20 | 18 pages |
| **[Integrating Feedback Loss from Bi-modal Sarcasm Detector for Sarcastic Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13028v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sarcastic speech synthesis, which involves generating speech that effectively conveys sarcasm, is essential for enhancing natural interactions in applications such as entertainment and human-computer interaction. However, synthesizing sarcastic speech remains a challenge due to the nuanced prosody that characterizes sarcasm, as well as the limited availability of annotated sarcastic speech data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel approach that integrates feedback loss from a bi-modal sarcasm detection model into the TTS training process, enhancing the model's ability to capture and convey sarcasm. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning, a speech synthesis model pre-trained on read speech undergoes a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, it is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset encompassing various speech styles, including sarcastic speech. In the second stage, the model is further refined using a dataset focused specifically on sarcastic speech, enhancing its ability to generate sarcasm-aware speech. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the quality, naturalness, and sarcasm-awareness of synthesized speech.</p></details> | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Speec...</summary><p>Speech Synthesis Workshop 2025</p></details> |

| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in LM-Based TTS Models via Distribution Alignment Using GFlowNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15442v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.</p></details> | 2025-08-21 |  |
| **[Your Reward Function for RL is Your Best PRM for Search: Unifying RL and Search-Based TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14313v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.</p></details> | 2025-08-19 |  |
| **[VisualSpeech: Enhancing Prosody Modeling in TTS Using Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19258v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis faces the inherent challenge of producing multiple speech outputs with varying prosody given a single text input. While previous research has addressed this by predicting prosodic information from both text and speech, additional contextual information, such as video, remains under-utilized despite being available in many applications. This paper investigates the potential of integrating visual context to enhance prosody prediction. We propose a novel model, VisualSpeech, which incorporates visual and textual information for improving prosody generation in TTS. Empirical results indicate that incorporating visual features improves prosodic modeling, enhancing the expressiveness of the synthesized speech. Audio samples are available at https://ariameetgit.github.io/VISUALSPEECH-SAMPLES/.</p></details> | 2025-08-16 |  |
| **[MoE-TTS: Enhancing Out-of-Domain Text Understanding for Description-based TTS via Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11326v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Description-based text-to-speech (TTS) models exhibit strong performance on in-domain text descriptions, i.e., those encountered during training. However, in real-world applications, the diverse range of user-generated descriptions inevitably introduces numerous out-of-domain inputs that challenge the text understanding capabilities of these systems. To address this issue, we propose MoE-TTS, a description-based TTS model designed to enhance the understanding of out-of-domain text descriptions. MoE-TTS employs a modality-based mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach to augment a pre-trained textual large language model (LLM) with a set of specialized weights adapted to the speech modality while maintaining the original LLM frozen during training. This approach allows MoE-TTS to effectively leverage the pre-trained knowledge and text understanding abilities of textual LLMs. Our experimental results indicate that: first, even the most advanced closed-source commercial products can be challenged by carefully designed out-of-domain description test sets; second, MoE-TTS achieves superior performance in generating speech that more accurately reflects the descriptions. We encourage readers to listen to the demos at https://welkinyang.github.io/MoE-TTS/.</p></details> | 2025-08-15 |  |
| **[Fairness in Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Understanding Intrinsic Bias in Dysarthric Speech Cloning using F5-TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05102v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges in developing assistive technologies, primarily due to the limited availability of data. Recent advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning, facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech technologies.</p></details> | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Facilitating Personalized TTS for Dysarthric Speakers Using Knowledge Anchoring and Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10412v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dysarthric speakers experience substantial communication challenges due to impaired motor control of the speech apparatus, which leads to reduced speech intelligibility. This creates significant obstacles in dataset curation since actual recording of long, articulate sentences for the objective of training personalized TTS models becomes infeasible. Thus, the limited availability of audio data, in addition to the articulation errors that are present within the audio, complicates personalized speech synthesis for target dysarthric speaker adaptation. To address this, we frame the issue as a domain transfer task and introduce a knowledge anchoring framework that leverages a teacher-student model, enhanced by curriculum learning through audio augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model effectively generates synthetic speech with markedly reduced articulation errors and high speaker fidelity, while maintaining prosodic naturalness.</p></details> | 2025-08-14 | Interspeech 2025 |

| **[DIFFA: Large Language Diffusion Models Can Listen and Understand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18452v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across textual and multimodal domains. In parallel, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, offering improved controllability, bidirectional context modeling, and robust generation. However, their application to the audio modality remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DIFFA}, the first diffusion-based large audio-language model designed to perform spoken language understanding. DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion language model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech understanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training pipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then, learning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs automatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960 hours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates competitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and VoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our results reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient and scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI. Our code will be available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git.</p></details> | 2025-08-21 |  |
| **[CLAIR-A: Leveraging Large Language Models to Judge Audio Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12962v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) task asks models to generate natural language descriptions of an audio input. Evaluating these machine-generated audio captions is a complex task that requires considering diverse factors, among them, auditory scene understanding, sound-object inference, temporal coherence, and the environmental context of the scene. While current methods focus on specific aspects, they often fail to provide an overall score that aligns well with human judgment. In this work, we propose CLAIR-A, a simple and flexible method that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate audio captions by directly asking LLMs for a semantic distance score. In our evaluations, CLAIR-A better predicts human judgements of quality compared to traditional metrics, with a 5.8% relative accuracy improvement compared to the domain-specific FENSE metric and up to 11% over the best general-purpose measure on the Clotho-Eval dataset. Moreover, CLAIR-A offers more transparency by allowing the language model to explain the reasoning behind its scores, with these explanations rated up to 30% better by human evaluators than those provided by baseline methods. CLAIR-A is made publicly available at https://github.com/DavidMChan/clair-a.</p></details> | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASRU 2025; Code is publicly available at

| **[Auditory Intelligence: Understanding the World Through Sound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07829v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in auditory intelligence has yielded high-performing systems for sound event detection (SED), acoustic scene classification (ASC), automated audio captioning (AAC), and audio question answering (AQA). Yet these tasks remain largely constrained to surface-level recognition-capturing what happened but not why, what it implies, or how it unfolds in context. I propose a conceptual reframing of auditory intelligence as a layered, situated process that encompasses perception, reasoning, and interaction. To instantiate this view, I introduce four cognitively inspired task paradigms-ASPIRE, SODA, AUX, and AUGMENT-those structure auditory understanding across time-frequency pattern captioning, hierarchical event/scene description, causal explanation, and goal-driven interpretation, respectively. Together, these paradigms provide a roadmap toward more generalizable, explainable, and human-aligned auditory intelligence, and are intended to catalyze a broader discussion of what it means for machines to understand sound.</p></details> | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Posit...</summary><p>Position paper without experimental/quantitative validation.

| **[MiDashengLM: Efficient Audio Understanding with General Audio Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03983v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches for large audio language models (LALMs) often rely on closed data sources or proprietary models, limiting their generalization and accessibility. This paper introduces MiDashengLM, a novel open audio-language model designed for efficient and comprehensive audio understanding through the use of general audio captions using our novel ACAVCaps training dataset. MiDashengLM exclusively relies on publicly available pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility. At its core, MiDashengLM integrates Dasheng, an open-source audio encoder, specifically engineered to process diverse auditory information effectively. Unlike previous works primarily focused on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based audio-text alignment, our strategy centers on general audio captions, fusing speech, sound and music information into one textual representation, enabling a holistic textual representation of complex audio scenes. Lastly, MiDashengLM provides an up to 4x speedup in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT) and up to 20x higher throughput than comparable models. Checkpoints are available online at https://huggingface.co/mispeech/midashenglm-7b and https://github.com/xiaomi-research/dasheng-lm.</p></details> | 2025-08-06 |  |
| **[From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01659v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To further strengthen this alignment, recent works have proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained audio discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness in enabling difference-telling and detailed discrimination, ADC introduces a notable semantic gap between the input audios-often rich in diverse sound events-and the relatively brief, difference-focused output captions. This deviation from AC-style descriptions leads to a mismatch with the pretraining objective, resulting in catastrophic forgetting during finetuning. To mitigate this issue, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that encourages the model to capture the shared semantics across audio clips rather than emphasizing their detailed differences. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC not only effectively enhances audio-text understanding on primary captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music-related downstream tasks, such as vocal sound classification (VSC), speech emotion recognition (SER), musical instrument classification (MIC), and music genre classification (MGC), compared to ADC. These findings validate that ACC contributes to more robust cross-modal understanding and achieves a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in the context of MLLMs.</p></details> | 2025-08-03 |  |

| **[LLaSO: A Foundational Framework for Reproducible Research in Large Language and Speech Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15418v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open, end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong, reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models, LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset, pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.</p></details> | 2025-08-21 |  |
| **[Benchmarking Prosody Encoding in Discrete Speech Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11224v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, discrete tokens derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) models via k-means clustering have been actively studied as pseudo-text in speech language models and as efficient intermediate representations for various tasks. However, these discrete tokens are typically learned in advance, separately from the training of language models or downstream tasks. As a result, choices related to discretization, such as the SSL model used or the number of clusters, must be made heuristically. In particular, speech language models are expected to understand and generate responses that reflect not only the semantic content but also prosodic features. Yet, there has been limited research on the ability of discrete tokens to capture prosodic information. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis focusing on prosodic encoding based on their sensitivity to the artificially modified prosody, aiming to provide practical guidelines for designing discrete tokens.</p></details> | 2025-08-15 | Accepted by ASRU2025 |
| **[OSUM-EChat: Enhancing End-to-End Empathetic Spoken Chatbot via Understanding-Driven Spoken Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09600v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empathy is crucial in enabling natural interactions within spoken dialogue systems, allowing machines to recognize and respond appropriately to paralinguistic cues such as age, gender, and emotion. Recent advancements in end-to-end speech language models, which unify speech understanding and generation, provide promising solutions. However, several challenges persist, including an over-reliance on large-scale dialogue datasets, insufficient extraction of paralinguistic cues vital for conveying empathy, and the lack of empathy-specific datasets and evaluation frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce OSUM-EChat, an open-source, end-to-end spoken dialogue system designed to enhance empathetic interactions, particularly in resource-limited settings. OSUM-EChat introduces two key innovations: (1) a three-stage understanding-driven spoken dialogue training strategy that extends the capabilities of a large speech understanding model to spoken dialogue tasks, and (2) a linguistic-paralinguistic dual thinking mechanism that integrates paralinguistic understanding through a chain of thought with dialogue generation, enabling the system to produce more empathetic responses. This approach reduces reliance on large-scale dialogue datasets while maintaining high-quality empathetic interactions. Additionally, we introduce the EChat-200K dataset, a rich corpus of empathetic speech-to-speech dialogues, and the EChat-eval benchmark, a comprehensive framework for evaluating the empathetic capabilities of dialogue systems. Experimental results demonstrate that OSUM-EChat outperforms end-to-end spoken dialogue models regarding empathetic responsiveness, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | 2025-08-13 |  |
| **[DualSpeechLM: Towards Unified Speech Understanding and Generation via Dual Speech Token Modeling with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08961v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)'s speech understanding or generation abilities by introducing various effective speech tokens has attracted great attention in the speech community. However, building a unified speech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges: (1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens, extending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data for fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information at different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features, while understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to difficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization and speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an Understanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level semantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text LLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which reduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech LLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that concurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a unified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision loss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and enhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between understanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of mutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.</p></details> | 2025-08-13 |  |
| **[Dual Information Speech Language Models for Emotional Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08095v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs) often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information within contextual settings.</p></details> | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Think Before You Talk: Enhancing Meaningful Dialogue Generation in Full-Duplex Speech Language Models with Planning-Inspired Text Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07375v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling complex conversational dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech, and End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue patterns for human-like interactions. However, they face a critical challenge -- their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken dialogue data. While text-guided speech generation could mitigate these issues, it suffers from timing and length issues when integrating textual guidance into double-channel audio streams, disrupting the precise time alignment essential for natural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose TurnGuide, a novel planning-inspired approach that mimics human conversational planning by dynamically segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating turn-level text guidance before speech output, which effectively resolves both insertion timing and length challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling them to generate semantically meaningful and coherent speech while maintaining natural conversational flow. Demos are available at https://dreamtheater123.github.io/TurnGuide-Demo/. Code will be available at https://github.com/dreamtheater123/TurnGuide.</p></details> | 2025-08-10 | Work in progress |
| **[Incorporating Contextual Paralinguistic Understanding in Large Speech-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07273v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations in empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that integrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we propose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information into model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic metadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit method that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs using both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech transcriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41% on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic understanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation with classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.</p></details> | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at (ASRU 2025) 2025 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and

| **[ProsodyLM: Uncovering the Emerging Prosody Processing Capabilities in Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20091v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long contexts.</p></details> | 2025-08-07 |  |
| **[Recent Advances in Speech Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03751v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant attention, primarily for their capabilities in text-based interactions. However, natural human interaction often relies on speech, necessitating a shift towards voice-based models. A straightforward approach to achieve this involves a pipeline of ``Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) + LLM + Text-to-Speech (TTS)", where input speech is transcribed to text, processed by an LLM, and then converted back to speech. Despite being straightforward, this method suffers from inherent limitations, such as information loss during modality conversion, significant latency due to the complex pipeline, and error accumulation across the three stages. To address these issues, Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) -- end-to-end models that generate speech without converting from text -- have emerged as a promising alternative.

A Systematic Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12537v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of speech tokenizer designs in LLM-centric SLMs, augmented by speech heads and speaker modeling. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.</p></details> | 2025-08-05 |  |
| **[Hearing More with Less: Multi-Modal Retrieval-and-Selection Augmented Conversational LLM-Based ASR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01166v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) aims to convert human speech content into corresponding text. In conversational scenarios, effectively utilizing context can enhance its accuracy. Large Language Models' (LLMs) exceptional long-context understanding and reasoning abilities enable LLM-based ASR (LLM-ASR) to leverage historical context for recognizing conversational speech, which has a high degree of contextual relevance. However, existing conversational LLM-ASR methods use a fixed number of preceding utterances or the entire conversation history as context, resulting in significant ASR confusion and computational costs due to massive irrelevant and redundant information. This paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval-and-selection method named MARS that augments conversational LLM-ASR by enabling it to retrieve and select the most relevant acoustic and textual historical context for the current utterance. Specifically, multi-modal retrieval obtains a set of candidate historical contexts, each exhibiting high acoustic or textual similarity to the current utterance. Multi-modal selection calculates the acoustic and textual similarities for each retrieved candidate historical context and, by employing our proposed near-ideal ranking method to consider both similarities, selects the best historical context. Evaluations on the Interspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge dataset show that the LLM-ASR, when trained on only 1.5K hours of data and equipped with the MARS, outperforms the state-of-the-art top-ranking system trained on 179K hours of data.</p></details> | 2025-08-02 |  |
| **[Scaling Analysis of Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02398v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Speech Language Model (SLM) scaling analysis paints a bleak picture. It predicts that SLMs require much more compute and data compared to text, leading some to question the feasibility of training high-quality SLMs. However, modern SLMs are often initialised from pre-trained TextLMs using speech-text interleaving to allow knowledge transfer. This raises the question - "Do interleaved SLMs scale more efficiently than textless-SLMs?" In this paper we answer a resounding yes! We conduct scaling analysis of interleaved SLMs by training several dozen and analysing the scaling trends. We see that under this setup SLMs scale more efficiently with compute. Additionally, our results indicate that the scaling dynamics significantly differ from textless-SLMs, suggesting one should allocate notably more of the compute budget to increasing model size over training tokens. We also study the role of synthetic data and TextLM model families in unlocking this potential. Results suggest that our scaled up model achieves comparable semantic speech performance to leading models, while using less compute and data. We open source models, samples, and data - https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/sims/ .</p></details> | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLM 2025</p></details> |

We propose a novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.</p></details> | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

| **[Locate-and-Focus: Enhancing Terminology Translation in Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18263v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays, yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.</p></details> | 2025-07-24 | Accepted at ACL 2025 |

Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups.

| **[FastLongSpeech: Enhancing Large Speech-Language Models for Efficient Long-Speech Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14815v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is at https://github.com/ictnlp/FastLongSpeech.

However, prior studies have found that existing dialogue pipelines for SARs remain limited in real-time latency, back-channeling, and personalized speech dialogue. Toward addressing these limitations, we propose using integrated end-to-end speech-language models (SLMs) with SARs. This work 1) evaluated the usability of an SLM-enabled SAR dialogue system through a small user study, and 2) identified remaining limitations through study user feedback to inform future improvements. We conducted a small within-participant user study with university students (N = 11) whose results showed that participants perceived an SLM-enabled SAR system as capable of providing empathetic feedback, natural turn-taking, back-channeling, and adaptive responses. We also found that participants reported the robot's nonverbal behaviors as lacking variability and synchronization with conversation, and the SLM's verbal feedback as generic and repetitive. These findings highlighted the need for real-time robot movement synchronized with conversation, improved prompting or fine-tuning to generate outputs better aligned with mental health practices, and more expressive, adaptive vocal generation.</p></details> | 2025-07-18 |  |
| **[StreamUni: Achieving Streaming Speech Translation with a Unified Large Speech-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07803v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality. However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.</p></details> | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is at https://github.com/ictnlp/StreamUni; The model is at

| **[Unlocking Speech Instruction Data Potential with Query Rewriting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08603v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets, previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets. Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting, increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and context-related abilities.</p></details> | 2025-07-11 | ACL 2025 Findings |

| **[Long-Form Speech Generation with Spoken Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18603v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time. From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time. Speech samples, the LibriSpeech-Long dataset, and any future code or model releases can be found at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/.</p></details> | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 (oral)</p></details> |

An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However, existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec, the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate.

To address these issues, we propose \textit{S2ST-Omni}, an efficient and scalable framework for multilingual S2ST. Specifically, we decompose the S2ST task into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). For S2TT, we propose an effective speech language model that integrates the pretrained Whisper encoder for robust audio understanding and Qwen 3.0 for advanced text comprehension. A lightweight speech adapter is employed to bridge the modality gap between speech and text representations. To further facilitate the multimodal knowledge learning, a two-stage fine-tuning strategy is introduced. In the TTS stage, we adopt a streaming autoregressive generation approach to produce natural and fluent target speech. Experiments on the CVSS benchmark show that S2ST-Omni consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art S2ST systems in translation quality, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | 2025-07-08 | Working in progress |

However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

| **[LM-SPT: LM-Aligned Semantic Distillation for Speech Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16738v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization, and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz. Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform baselines on text-to-speech tasks.</p></details> | 2025-06-20 |  |

We know that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show robust performance gains.</p></details> | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long token sequence length.

| **[NTPP: Generative Speech Language Modeling for Dual-Channel Spoken Dialogue via Next-Token-Pair Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00975v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.</p></details> | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/OmniCharacter.</p></details> | 2025-06-05 | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks. Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for spoken language generation.

| **[Language-Codec: Bridging Discrete Codec Representations and Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12208v4)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models have achieved significant success in generative tasks related to speech, audio, music, and other signal domains. A crucial element of these models is the discrete acoustic codecs, which serve as an intermediate representation replacing the mel-spectrogram. However, there exist several gaps between discrete codecs and downstream speech language models. Specifically, 1) Due to the reconstruction paradigm of the Codec model and the structure of residual vector quantization, the initial channel of the codebooks contains excessive information, making it challenging to directly generate acoustic tokens from weakly supervised signals such as text in downstream tasks. 2) numerous codebooks increases the burden on downstream speech language models. Consequently, leveraging the characteristics of speech language models, we propose Language-Codec. In the Language-Codec, we introduce a Masked Channel Residual Vector Quantization (MCRVQ) mechanism along with improved fourier transform structures and attention blocks, refined discriminator design to address the aforementioned gaps. We compare our method with competing audio compression algorithms and observe significant outperformance across extensive evaluations. Furthermore, we also validate the efficiency of the Language-Codec on downstream speech language models.

While speech tokenization has many options, their effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.</p></details> | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech2025</p></details> |

The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models.

The richer speech signal introduces new security risks compared to text-based models, as adversaries can better bypass safety mechanisms by injecting imperceptible noise to speech. We analyze adversarial attacks and find that SLMs are substantially more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate in some instances. To improve security, we propose post-hoc patching defenses used to intervene during inference by modifying the SLM's activations that improve robustness up to 99% with (i) negligible impact on utility and (ii) without any re-training. We conduct ablation studies to maximize the efficacy of our defenses and improve the utility/security trade-off, validated with large-scale benchmarks unique to SLMs.</p></details> | 2025-05-18 |  |

Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training pipeline that includes the distillation and fine-tuning phases to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.</p></details> | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Train...</summary><p>Training and Inference Codes: https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/VITA-Audio</p></details> |

Existing methods focus primarily on reducing the word error rate while ignoring the importance of lip-sync and acoustic quality. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM) based flow matching architecture for dubbing, named FlowDubber, which achieves high-quality audio-visual sync and pronunciation by incorporating a large speech language model and dual contrastive aligning while achieving better acoustic quality via the proposed voice-enhanced flow matching than previous works. First, we introduce Qwen2.5 as the backbone of LLM to learn the in-context sequence from movie scripts and reference audio. Then, the proposed semantic-aware learning focuses on capturing LLM semantic knowledge at the phoneme level. Next, dual contrastive aligning (DCA) boosts mutual alignment with lip movement, reducing ambiguities where similar phonemes might be confused. Finally, the proposed Flow-based Voice Enhancing (FVE) improves acoustic quality in two aspects, which introduces an LLM-based acoustics flow matching guidance to strengthen clarity and uses affine style prior to enhance identity when recovering noise into mel-spectrograms via gradient vector field prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two primary benchmarks.

This paper introduces Ichigo, a mixed-modal model that seamlessly processes interleaved sequences of speech and text. Utilizing a tokenized early-fusion approach, Ichigo quantizes speech into discrete tokens and employs a uniform transformer-based architecture for both speech and text modalities. This method enables joint reasoning and generation across modalities without the need for separate adapters. We present a comprehensive training methodology, including pre-training on multilingual speech recognition datasets and fine-tuning on a curated instruction dataset. Ichigo demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on speech question-answering benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source speech language models and achieving comparable results to cascaded systems. Notably, Ichigo exhibits a latency of just 111 ms to first token generation, significantly lower than current models. Our approach not only advances the field of multimodal AI but also provides a framework for smaller research teams to contribute effectively to open-source speech-language models.</p></details> | 2025-04-04 |  |

Discrete speech token is often utilized in text-to-speech tasks for speech compression and portability, which is convenient for joint training with text and have good compression efficiency. However, we found that the discrete speech tokenizer still suffers from information loss. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective continuous speech tokenizer named Cont-SPT, and a text-to-speech model based on continuous speech tokens. Our results show that the speech language model based on the continuous speech tokenizer has better continuity and higher estimated Mean Opinion Scores (MoS). This enhancement is attributed to better information preservation rate of the continuous speech tokenizer across both low and high frequencies in the frequency domain.

However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging for the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or totally without vision-understanding capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech abilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we surprisingly notice that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is introduced for the flexible speech style controls including emotions and pitches. For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.</p></details> | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

| **[Universal Speech Token Learning via Low-Bitrate Neural Codec and Pretrained Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12115v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large speech language models are mainly based on semantic tokens from discretization of self-supervised learned representations and acoustic tokens from a neural codec, following a semantic-modeling and acoustic-synthesis paradigm. However, semantic tokens discard paralinguistic attributes of speakers that is important for natural spoken communication, while prompt-based acoustic synthesis from semantic tokens has limits in recovering paralinguistic details and suffers from robustness issues, especially when there are domain gaps between the prompt and the target. This paper unifies two types of tokens and proposes the UniCodec, a universal speech token learning that encapsulates all semantics of speech, including linguistic and paralinguistic information, into a compact and semantically-disentangled unified token. Such a unified token can not only benefit speech language models in understanding with paralinguistic hints but also help speech generation with high-quality output. A low-bitrate neural codec is leveraged to learn such disentangled discrete representations at global and local scales, with knowledge distilled from self-supervised learned features. Extensive evaluations on multilingual datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in generating natural, expressive and long-term consistent output quality with paralinguistic attributes well preserved in several speech processing tasks.</p></details> | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal

We hypothesize that this method limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality, preventing text-learned functions from being fully leveraged at appropriate abstraction levels. To address this, we propose augmenting vocabulary expansion with modules that better align abstraction levels across layers. Our models, \textsc{SmolTolk}, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with orders of magnitude more compute. Representation analyses and improved multimodal performance suggest our method enhances cross-modal transfer.</p></details> | 2025-03-08 |  |

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities.

However, current models rely heavily on low-level speech features, indicating they lack brain-relevant semantics which limits their utility as model organisms of semantic processing in the brain. In this work, we address this limitation by inducing brain-relevant bias directly into the models via fine-tuning with fMRI recordings of people listening to natural stories, a process we name brain-tuning. After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models' semantic understanding.</p></details> | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Earlier SpeechLMs focused on single-turn speech-based question answering (QA), where user input comprised a speech context and a text question. More recent studies have extended this to multi-turn conversations, though they often require complex, multi-stage supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with diverse data. Another critical challenge with SpeechLMs is catastrophic forgetting, where models optimized for speech tasks suffer significant degradation in text-only performance. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel single-stage joint speech-text SFT approach on the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of the LLM backbone. Our joint SFT combines text-only SFT data with three types of speech-related data: speech recognition and translation, speech-based QA, and mixed-modal SFT. Compared to previous SpeechLMs with 7B or 13B parameters, our 3B model demonstrates superior performance across various speech benchmarks while preserving the original capabilities on text-only tasks. Furthermore, our model shows emergent abilities of effectively handling previously unseen prompts and tasks, including multi-turn, mixed-modal inputs.</p></details> | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

Such models have the ability to model the rich acoustic information existing in audio signals, beyond spoken content, such as emotion, background noise, etc. Despite this, evaluation benchmarks which evaluate awareness to a wide range of acoustic aspects, are lacking. To help bridge this gap, we introduce SALMon, a novel evaluation suite encompassing background noise, emotion, speaker identity and room impulse response. The proposed benchmarks both evaluate the consistency of the inspected element and how much it matches the spoken text. We follow a modelling based approach, measuring whether a model gives correct samples higher scores than incorrect ones. This approach makes the benchmark fast to compute even for large models. We evaluated several speech language models on SALMon, thus highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each evaluated method. We make the code and data publicly available at https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/salmon/ .</p></details> | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025, project page -

| **[Unsupervised Speech Segmentation: A General Approach Using Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03711v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised approach for Speech Segmentation, which builds on previously researched approaches, e.g., Speaker Diarization, while being applicable to an inclusive set of acoustic-semantic distinctions, paving a path towards a general Unsupervised Speech Segmentation approach. Unlike traditional speech and audio segmentation, which mainly focuses on spectral changes in the input signal, e.g., phone segmentation, our approach tries to segment the spoken utterance into chunks with differing acoustic-semantic styles, focusing on acoustic-semantic information that does not translate well into text, e.g., emotion or speaker. While most Speech Segmentation tasks only handle one style change, e.g., emotion diarization, our approach tries to handle multiple acoustic-semantic style changes. Leveraging recent advances in Speech Language Models (SLMs), we propose a simple unsupervised method to segment a given speech utterance. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by considering several setups. Results suggest that the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines on boundary detection, segment purity, and over-segmentation.

| **[Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation without Automatic Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16500v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One common approach for question answering over speech data is to first transcribe speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then employ text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the transcriptions. While this cascaded pipeline has proven effective in many practical settings, ASR errors can propagate to the retrieval and generation steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for open-question answering over spoken data. Our proposed approach fine-tunes a pre-trained speech encoder into a speech adapter fed into a frozen large language model (LLM)--based retrieval model. By aligning the embedding spaces of text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from text-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text retriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show that direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and outperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech language model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than transcripts. Without fine-tuning of the SLM, this approach outperforms cascaded text-based models when there is high WER in the transcripts.</p></details> | 2025-01-03 | ICASSP 2025 |

However, the generated speech samples often lack semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose SLM and LLM Integration for spontaneous spoken Dialogue gEneration (SLIDE). Specifically, we first utilize an LLM to generate the textual content of spoken dialogue. Next, we convert the textual dialogues into phoneme sequences and use a two-tower transformer-based duration predictor to predict the duration of each phoneme. Finally, an SLM conditioned on the spoken phoneme sequences is used to vocalize the textual dialogue. Experimental results on the Fisher dataset demonstrate that our system can generate naturalistic spoken dialogue while maintaining high semantic coherence.</p></details> | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Why Do Speech Language Models Fail to Generate Semantically Coherent Outputs? A Modality Evolving Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17048v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although text-based large language models exhibit human-level writing ability and remarkable intelligence, speech language models (SLMs) still struggle to generate semantically coherent outputs. There are several potential reasons for this performance degradation: (A) speech tokens mainly provide phonetic information rather than semantic information, (B) the length of speech sequences is much longer than that of text sequences, and (C) paralinguistic information, such as prosody, introduces additional complexity and variability. In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling. Based on these findings, we provide insights into the unique challenges of training SLMs and highlight pathways to develop more effective end-to-end SLMs.</p></details> | 2024-12-22 |  |
| **[SECodec: Structural Entropy-based Compressive Speech Representation Codec for Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00018v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech representations have become crucial for integrating speech into LLMs. Existing methods for speech representation discretization rely on a predefined codebook size and Euclidean distance-based quantization. However, 1) the size of codebook is a critical parameter that affects both codec performance and downstream task training efficiency. 2) The Euclidean distance-based quantization may lead to audio distortion when the size of the codebook is controlled within a reasonable range. In fact, in the field of information compression, structural information and entropy guidance are crucial, but previous methods have largely overlooked these factors. Therefore, we address the above issues from an information-theoretic perspective, we present SECodec, a novel speech representation codec based on structural entropy (SE) for building speech language models. Specifically, we first model speech as a graph, clustering the speech features nodes within the graph and extracting the corresponding codebook by hierarchically and disentangledly minimizing 2D SE. Then, to address the issue of audio distortion, we propose a new quantization method. This method still adheres to the 2D SE minimization principle, adaptively selecting the most suitable token corresponding to the cluster for each incoming original speech node. Furthermore, we develop a Structural Entropy-based Speech Language Model (SESLM) that leverages SECodec. Experimental results demonstrate that SECodec performs comparably to EnCodec in speech reconstruction, and SESLM surpasses VALL-E in zero-shot text-to-speech tasks. Code, demo speeches, speech feature graph, SE codebook, and models are available at https://github.com/wlq2019/SECodec.</p></details> | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial

It supports both Chinese and English, engages in real-time voice conversations, and varies vocal nuances such as emotion, intonation, speech rate, and dialect according to user instructions. GLM-4-Voice uses an ultra-low bitrate (175bps), single-codebook speech tokenizer with 12.5Hz frame rate derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by incorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. To efficiently transfer knowledge from text to speech modalities, we synthesize speech-text interleaved data from existing text pre-training corpora using a text-to-token model. We continue pre-training from the pre-trained text language model GLM-4-9B with a combination of unsupervised speech data, interleaved speech-text data, and supervised speech-text data, scaling up to 1 trillion tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both speech language modeling and spoken question answering. We then fine-tune the pre-trained model with high-quality conversational speech data, achieving superior performance compared to existing baselines in both conversational ability and speech quality. The open models can be accessed through https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4-Voice and https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-4-voice-9b.</p></details> | 2024-12-03 |  |

| **[Scaling Speech-Text Pre-training with Synthetic Interleaved Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17607v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech language models (SpeechLMs) accept speech input and produce speech output, allowing for more natural human-computer interaction compared to text-based large language models (LLMs). Traditional approaches for developing SpeechLMs are constrained by the limited availability of unsupervised speech data and parallel speech-text data, which are significantly less abundant than text pre-training data, thereby limiting their scalability as LLMs. We propose a novel approach to scaling speech-text pre-training by leveraging large-scale synthetic interleaved data derived from text corpora, eliminating the need for parallel speech-text datasets. Our method efficiently constructs speech-text interleaved data by sampling text spans from existing text corpora and synthesizing corresponding speech spans using a text-to-token model, bypassing the need to generate actual speech. We also employ a supervised speech tokenizer derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by incorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. This supervised training approach results in discrete speech tokens with strong semantic preservation even at lower frame rates (e.g. 12.5Hz), while still maintaining speech reconstruction quality. Starting from a pre-trained language model and scaling our pre-training to 1 trillion tokens (with 600B synthetic interleaved speech-text data), we achieve state-of-the-art performance in speech language modeling and spoken question answering, improving performance on spoken questions tasks from the previous SOTA of 13% (Moshi) to 31%. We further demonstrate that by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with speech dialogue data, we can develop an end-to-end spoken chatbot that achieves competitive performance comparable to existing baselines in both conversational abilities and speech quality, even operating exclusively in the speech domain.</p></details> | 2024-12-02 |  |
| **[Generative Pre-trained Speech Language Model with Efficient Hierarchical Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00976v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in speech language models have achieved significant progress, they face remarkable challenges in modeling the long acoustic sequences of neural audio codecs. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{S}peech \textbf{T}ransformer (GPST), a hierarchical transformer designed for efficient speech language modeling. GPST quantizes audio waveforms into two distinct types of discrete speech representations and integrates them within a hierarchical transformer architecture, allowing for a unified one-stage generation process and enhancing Hi-Res audio generation capabilities. By training on large corpora of speeches in an end-to-end unsupervised manner, GPST can generate syntactically consistent speech with diverse speaker identities. Given a brief 3-second prompt, GPST can produce natural and coherent personalized speech, demonstrating in-context learning abilities. Moreover, our approach can be easily extended to spoken cross-lingual speech generation by incorporating multi-lingual semantic tokens and universal acoustic tokens. Experimental results indicate that GPST significantly outperforms the existing speech language models in terms of word error rate, speech quality, and speaker similarity.

| **[DM-Codec: Distilling Multimodal Representations for Speech Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15017v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in speech-language models have yielded significant improvements in speech tokenization and synthesis. However, effectively mapping the complex, multidimensional attributes of speech into discrete tokens remains challenging. This process demands acoustic, semantic, and contextual information for precise speech representations. Existing speech representations generally fall into two categories: acoustic tokens from audio codecs and semantic tokens from speech self-supervised learning models. Although recent efforts have unified acoustic and semantic tokens for improved performance, they overlook the crucial role of contextual representation in comprehensive speech modeling. Our empirical investigations reveal that the absence of contextual representations results in elevated Word Error Rate (WER) and Word Information Lost (WIL) scores in speech transcriptions. To address these limitations, we propose two novel distillation approaches: (1) a language model (LM)-guided distillation method that incorporates contextual information, and (2) a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided distillation technique that effectively distills multimodal representations (acoustic, semantic, and contextual) into a comprehensive speech tokenizer, termed DM-Codec. The DM-Codec architecture adopts a streamlined encoder-decoder framework with a Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) and incorporates the LM and SM during the training process. Experiments show DM-Codec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art speech tokenization models, reducing WER by up to 13.46%, WIL by 9.82%, and improving speech quality by 5.84% and intelligibility by 1.85% on the LibriSpeech benchmark dataset.

| **[SyllableLM: Learning Coarse Semantic Units for Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04029v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models require tokenized inputs. However, tokenization strategies for continuous data like audio and vision are often based on simple heuristics such as fixed sized convolutions or discrete clustering, which do not necessarily align with the semantic structure of the data. For speech in particular, the high resolution of waveforms (16,000 samples/second or more) presents a significant challenge as speech-based language models have had to use several times more tokens per word than text-based language models. In this work, we introduce a controllable self-supervised technique to merge speech representations into coarser syllable-like units while still preserving semantic information. We do this by 1) extracting noisy boundaries through analyzing correlations in pretrained encoder losses and 2) iteratively improving model representations with a novel distillation technique. Our method produces controllable-rate semantic units at as low as 5Hz and 60bps and achieves SotA in syllabic segmentation and clustering. Using these coarse tokens, we successfully train SyllableLM, a Speech Language Model (SpeechLM) that matches or outperforms current SotA SpeechLMs on a range of spoken language modeling tasks. SyllableLM also achieves significant improvements in efficiency with a 30x reduction in training compute and a 4x wall-clock inference speedup.</p></details> | 2024-10-05 | 10 pages, 2 figures |

A Study on Speech Large Language Models' Ability to Identify and Understand Speaker in Spoken Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04927v3)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, we have observed a rapid advancement in speech language models (SpeechLLMs), catching up with humans' listening and reasoning abilities. SpeechLLMs have demonstrated impressive spoken dialog question-answering (SQA) performance in benchmarks like Gaokao, the English listening test of the college entrance exam in China, which seemingly requires understanding both the spoken content and voice characteristics of speakers in a conversation. However, after carefully examining Gaokao's questions, we find the correct answers to many questions can be inferred from the conversation transcript alone, i.e.\ without speaker segmentation and identification. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models Qwen-Audio and WavLLM on both Gaokao and our proposed "What Do You Like?" dataset shows a significantly higher accuracy in these context-based questions than in identity-critical questions, which can only be answered reliably with correct speaker identification. The results and analysis suggest that when solving SQA, the current SpeechLLMs exhibit limited speaker awareness from the audio and behave similarly to an LLM reasoning from the conversation transcription without sound. We propose that tasks focused on identity-critical questions could offer a more accurate evaluation framework of SpeechLLMs in SQA.</p></details> | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE SLT 2024</p></details> |

The ideal neural audio codec should maintain content, paralinguistics, speaker characteristics, and audio information even at low bitrates. Recently, numerous advanced neural codec models have been proposed. However, codec models are often tested under varying experimental conditions. As a result, we introduce the Codec-SUPERB challenge at SLT 2024, designed to facilitate fair and lightweight comparisons among existing codec models and inspire advancements in the field.

| **[LAST: Language Model Aware Speech Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03701v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech tokenization serves as the foundation of speech language model (LM), enabling them to perform various tasks such as spoken language modeling, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, etc. Most speech tokenizers are trained independently of the LM training process, relying on separate acoustic models and quantization methods. Following such an approach may create a mismatch between the tokenization process and its usage afterward. In this study, we propose a novel approach to training a speech tokenizer by leveraging objectives from pre-trained textual LMs. We advocate for the integration of this objective into the process of learning discrete speech representations. Our aim is to transform features from a pre-trained speech model into a new feature space that enables better clustering for speech LMs. We empirically investigate the impact of various model design choices, including speech vocabulary size and text LM size. Our results demonstrate the proposed tokenization method outperforms the evaluated baselines considering both spoken language modeling and speech-to-text. More importantly, unlike prior work, the proposed method allows the utilization of a single pre-trained LM for processing both speech and text inputs, setting it apart from conventional tokenization approaches.</p></details> | 2024-09-10 |  |

However, there is no systematic understanding on how the codec system affects the speech generation performance of the SLM. In this work, we examine codec tokens within SLM framework for speech generation to provide insights for effective codec design. We retrain existing high-performing neural codec models on the same data set and loss functions to compare their performance in a uniform setting. We integrate codec tokens into two SLM systems: masked-based parallel speech generation system and an auto-regressive (AR) plus non-auto-regressive (NAR) model-based system. Our findings indicate that better speech reconstruction in codec systems does not guarantee improved speech generation in SLM. A high-quality codec decoder is crucial for natural speech production in SLM, while speech intelligibility depends more on quantization mechanism.</p></details> | 2024-09-06 | Accepted by SLT-2024 |
| **[SpeechPrompt: Prompting Speech Language Models for Speech Processing Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13040v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a practical method for utilizing pre-trained language models (LMs). This approach offers several advantages. It allows an LM to adapt to new tasks with minimal training and parameter updates, thus achieving efficiency in both storage and computation. Additionally, prompting modifies only the LM's inputs and harnesses the generative capabilities of language models to address various downstream tasks in a unified manner. This significantly reduces the need for human labor in designing task-specific models. These advantages become even more evident as the number of tasks served by the LM scales up. Motivated by the strengths of prompting, we are the first to explore the potential of prompting speech LMs in the domain of speech processing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in converting speech into discrete units for language modeling. Our pioneer research demonstrates that these quantized speech units are highly versatile within our unified prompting framework. Not only can they serve as class labels, but they also contain rich phonetic information that can be re-synthesized back into speech signals for speech generation tasks. Specifically, we reformulate speech processing tasks into speech-to-unit generation tasks. As a result, we can seamlessly integrate tasks such as speech classification, sequence generation, and speech generation within a single, unified prompting framework. The experiment results show that the prompting method can achieve competitive performance compared to the strong fine-tuning method based on self-supervised learning models with a similar number of trainable parameters. The prompting method also shows promising results in the few-shot setting. Moreover, with the advanced speech LMs coming into the stage, the proposed prompting framework attains great potential.</p></details> | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language

Recent advancements in speech language models (SLM) have significantly enhanced speech-based conversational AI. However, these models are limited to turn-based conversation, lacking the ability to interact with humans in real-time spoken scenarios, for example, being interrupted when the generated content is not satisfactory. To address these limitations, we explore full duplex modeling (FDM) in interactive speech language models (iSLM), focusing on enhancing real-time interaction and, more explicitly, exploring the quintessential ability of interruption. We introduce a novel model design, namely listening-while-speaking language model (LSLM), an end-to-end system equipped with both listening and speaking channels. Our LSLM employs a token-based decoder-only TTS for speech generation and a streaming self-supervised learning (SSL) encoder for real-time audio input. LSLM fuses both channels for autoregressive generation and detects turn-taking in real time. Three fusion strategies -- early fusion, middle fusion, and late fusion -- are explored, with middle fusion achieving an optimal balance between speech generation and real-time interaction. Two experimental settings, command-based FDM and voice-based FDM, demonstrate LSLM's robustness to noise and sensitivity to diverse instructions. Our results highlight LSLM's capability to achieve duplex communication with minimal impact on existing systems. This study aims to advance the development of interactive speech dialogue systems, enhancing their applicability in real-world contexts.</p></details> | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo can be found at https://ddlbojack.github.io/LSLM</p></details> |

Preserving emotional information in codecs is crucial for effective communication and context understanding. However, there is a lack of studies on emotion loss in existing codecs. This paper evaluates neural and legacy codecs using subjective and objective methods on emotion datasets like IEMOCAP. Our study identifies which codecs best preserve emotional information under various bitrate scenarios. We found that training codec models with both English and Chinese data had limited success in retaining emotional information in Chinese. Additionally, resynthesizing speech through these codecs degrades the performance of speech emotion recognition (SER), particularly for emotions like sadness, depression, fear, and disgust. Human listening tests confirmed these findings. This work guides future speech technology developments to ensure new codecs maintain the integrity of emotional information in speech.</p></details> | 2024-07-30 |  |

The previous architectures can be categorized as: i) GPT-style, prepend speech prompts to the text prompts as a sequence of LLM inputs like a decoder-only model; ii) T5-style, introduce speech cross-attention to each layer of the pretrained LLMs. We propose BESTOW architecture to bring the BESt features from TwO Worlds into a single model that is highly efficient and has strong multitask capabilities. Moreover, there is no clear streaming solution for either style, especially considering the solution should generalize to speech multitask. We reformulate streamable SpeechLLM as a read-write policy problem and unifies the offline and streaming research with BESTOW architecture. Hence we demonstrate the first open-source SpeechLLM solution that enables Streaming and Multitask at scale (beyond ASR) at the same time. This streamable solution achieves very strong performance on a wide range of speech tasks (ASR, AST, SQA, unseen DynamicSuperb). It is end-to-end optimizable, with lower training/inference cost, and demonstrates LLM knowledge transferability to speech.</p></details> | 2024-06-28 |  |

| **[GenDistiller: Distilling Pre-trained Language Models based on an Autoregressive Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09444v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained speech language models such as HuBERT and WavLM leverage unlabeled speech data for self-supervised learning and offer powerful representations for numerous downstream tasks. Despite the success of these models, their high requirements for memory and computing resource hinder their application on resource restricted devices. Therefore, this paper introduces GenDistiller, a novel knowledge distillation framework which generates the hidden representations of the pre-trained teacher model directly by a much smaller student network. The proposed method takes the previous hidden layer as history and implements a layer-by-layer prediction of the teacher model autoregressively. Experiments on SUPERB reveal the advantage of GenDistiller over the baseline distilling method without an autoregressive framework, with 33% fewer parameters, similar time consumption and better performance on most of the SUPERB tasks. Ultimately, the proposed GenDistiller reduces the size of WavLM by 82%.</p></details> | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.13418</p></details> |
| **[Instruction Data Generation and Unsupervised Adaptation for Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12946v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose three methods for generating synthetic samples to train and evaluate multimodal large language models capable of processing both text and speech inputs. Addressing the scarcity of samples containing both modalities, synthetic data generation emerges as a crucial strategy to enhance the performance of such systems and facilitate the modeling of cross-modal relationships between the speech and text domains. Our process employs large language models to generate textual components and text-to-speech systems to generate speech components. The proposed methods offer a practical and effective means to expand the training dataset for these models. Experimental results show progress in achieving an integrated understanding of text and speech. We also highlight the potential of using unlabeled speech data to generate synthetic samples comparable in quality to those with available transcriptions, enabling the expansion of these models to more languages.</p></details> | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Interspeech 2024</p></details> |
| **[Speech language models lack important brain-relevant semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04664v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite known differences between reading and listening in the brain, recent work has shown that text-based language models predict both text-evoked and speech-evoked brain activity to an impressive degree. This poses the question of what types of information language models truly predict in the brain. We investigate this question via a direct approach, in which we systematically remove specific low-level stimulus features (textual, speech, and visual) from language model representations to assess their impact on alignment with fMRI brain recordings during reading and listening. Comparing these findings with speech-based language models reveals starkly different effects of low-level features on brain alignment. While text-based models show reduced alignment in early sensory regions post-removal, they retain significant predictive power in late language regions. In contrast, speech-based models maintain strong alignment in early auditory regions even after feature removal but lose all predictive power in late language regions. These results suggest that speech-based models provide insights into additional information processed by early auditory regions, but caution is needed when using them to model processing in late language regions. We make our code publicly available.

| **[NAST: Noise Aware Speech Tokenization for Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11037v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech tokenization is the task of representing speech signals as a sequence of discrete units. Such representations can be later used for various downstream tasks including automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, etc. More relevant to this study, such representation serves as the basis of Speech Language Models. In this work, we tackle the task of speech tokenization under the noisy setup and present NAST: Noise Aware Speech Tokenization for Speech Language Models. NAST is composed of three main components: (i) a predictor; (ii) a residual encoder; and (iii) a decoder. We evaluate the efficiency of NAST considering several spoken language modeling tasks and show that NAST is superior to the evaluated baselines across all setups. Lastly, we analyze NAST and show its disentanglement properties and robustness to signal variations in the form of noise, reverberation, pitch-shift, and time-stretch. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ShovalMessica/NAST.</p></details> | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2024</p></details> |
| **[Exploring In-Context Learning of Textless Speech Language Model for Speech Classification Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12477v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ever since the development of GPT-3 in the natural language processing (NLP) field, in-context learning (ICL) has played an essential role in utilizing large language models (LLMs). By presenting the LM utterance-label demonstrations at the input, the LM can accomplish few-shot learning without relying on gradient descent or requiring explicit modification of its parameters. This enables the LM to perform various downstream tasks in a black-box manner. Despite the success of ICL in NLP, little work is exploring the possibility of ICL in speech processing. This study is the first work exploring ICL for speech classification tasks with textless speech LM. We first show that the current speech LM lacks the ICL capability. We then perform warmup training on the speech LM, equipping the LM with demonstration learning capability. This paper explores and proposes the first speech LM capable of performing unseen classification tasks in an ICL manner.</p></details> | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2024.

| **[BLSP-Emo: Towards Empathetic Large Speech-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03872v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent release of GPT-4o showcased the potential of end-to-end multimodal models, not just in terms of low latency but also in their ability to understand and generate expressive speech with rich emotions. While the details are unknown to the open research community, it likely involves significant amounts of curated data and compute, neither of which is readily accessible. In this paper, we present BLSP-Emo (Bootstrapped Language-Speech Pretraining with Emotion support), a novel approach to developing an end-to-end speech-language model capable of understanding both semantics and emotions in speech and generate empathetic responses. BLSP-Emo utilizes existing speech recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets through a two-stage process. The first stage focuses on semantic alignment, following recent work on pretraining speech-language models using ASR data. The second stage performs emotion alignment with the pretrained speech-language model on an emotion-aware continuation task constructed from SER data. Our experiments demonstrate that the BLSP-Emo model excels in comprehending speech and delivering empathetic responses, both in instruction-following tasks and conversations.</p></details> | 2024-06-06 |  |
| **[SeamlessExpressiveLM: Speech Language Model for Expressive Speech-to-Speech Translation with Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20410v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is a key research topic in seamless communication, which focuses on the preservation of semantics and speaker vocal style in translated speech. Early works synthesized speaker style aligned speech in order to directly learn the mapping from speech to target speech spectrogram. Without reliance on style aligned data, recent studies leverage the advances of language modeling (LM) and build cascaded LMs on semantic and acoustic tokens. This work proposes SeamlessExpressiveLM, a single speech language model for expressive S2ST. We decompose the complex source-to-target speech mapping into intermediate generation steps with chain-of-thought prompting. The model is first guided to translate target semantic content and then transfer the speaker style to multi-stream acoustic units. Evaluated on Spanish-to-English and Hungarian-to-English translations, SeamlessExpressiveLM outperforms cascaded LMs in both semantic quality and style transfer, meanwhile achieving better parameter efficiency.</p></details> | 2024-05-30 |  |
| **[Evaluating Text-to-Speech Synthesis from a Large Discrete Token-based Speech Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09768v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative language modeling applied to discrete speech tokens presented a new avenue for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. These speech language models (SLMs), similarly to their textual counterparts, are scalable, probabilistic, and context-aware. While they can produce diverse and natural outputs, they sometimes face issues such as unintelligibility and the inclusion of non-speech noises or hallucination. As the adoption of this innovative paradigm in speech synthesis increases, there is a clear need for an in-depth evaluation of its capabilities and limitations. In this paper, we evaluate TTS from a discrete token-based SLM, through both automatic metrics and listening tests. We examine five key dimensions: speaking style, intelligibility, speaker consistency, prosodic variation, spontaneous behaviour. Our results highlight the model's strength in generating varied prosody and spontaneous outputs. It is also rated higher in naturalness and context appropriateness in listening tests compared to a conventional TTS. However, the model's performance in intelligibility and speaker consistency lags behind traditional TTS. Additionally, we show that increasing the scale of SLMs offers a modest boost in robustness. Our findings aim to serve as a benchmark for future advancements in generative SLMs for speech synthesis.</p></details> | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

| **[SpeechGuard: Exploring the Adversarial Robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08317v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated Speech and Large Language Models (SLMs) that can follow speech instructions and generate relevant text responses have gained popularity lately. However, the safety and robustness of these models remains largely unclear. In this work, we investigate the potential vulnerabilities of such instruction-following speech-language models to adversarial attacks and jailbreaking. Specifically, we design algorithms that can generate adversarial examples to jailbreak SLMs in both white-box and black-box attack settings without human involvement. Additionally, we propose countermeasures to thwart such jailbreaking attacks. Our models, trained on dialog data with speech instructions, achieve state-of-the-art performance on spoken question-answering task, scoring over 80% on both safety and helpfulness metrics. Despite safety guardrails, experiments on jailbreaking demonstrate the vulnerability of SLMs to adversarial perturbations and transfer attacks, with average attack success rates of 90% and 10% respectively when evaluated on a dataset of carefully designed harmful questions spanning 12 different toxic categories. However, we demonstrate that our proposed countermeasures reduce the attack success significantly.</p></details> | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>9+6 p...</summary><p>9+6 pages, Submitted to ACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Properties of Speech Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00685v2)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn language from raw audio, without textual resources. Despite significant advances, our current models exhibit weak syntax and semantic abilities. However, if the scaling properties of neural language models hold for the speech modality, these abilities will improve as the amount of compute used for training increases. In this paper, we use models of this scaling behavior to estimate the scale at which our current methods will yield a SLM with the English proficiency of text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). We establish a strong correlation between pre-training loss and downstream syntactic and semantic performance in SLMs and LLMs, which results in predictable scaling of linguistic performance. We show that the linguistic performance of SLMs scales up to three orders of magnitude more slowly than that of text-based LLMs. Additionally, we study the benefits of synthetic data designed to boost semantic understanding and the effects of coarser speech tokenization.</p></details> | 2024-04-16 |  |
| **[SpeechAlign: Aligning Speech Generation to Human Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05600v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech language models have significantly advanced in generating realistic speech, with neural codec language models standing out. However, the integration of human feedback to align speech outputs to human preferences is often neglected. This paper addresses this gap by first analyzing the distribution gap in codec language models, highlighting how it leads to discrepancies between the training and inference phases, which negatively affects performance. Then we explore leveraging learning from human feedback to bridge the distribution gap. We introduce SpeechAlign, an iterative self-improvement strategy that aligns speech language models to human preferences. SpeechAlign involves constructing a preference codec dataset contrasting golden codec tokens against synthetic tokens, followed by preference optimization to improve the codec language model. This cycle of improvement is carried out iteratively to steadily convert weak models to strong ones. Through both subjective and objective evaluations, we show that SpeechAlign can bridge the distribution gap and facilitating continuous self-improvement of the speech language model. Moreover, SpeechAlign exhibits robust generalization capabilities and works for smaller models.

| **[An Empirical Study of Speech Language Models for Prompt-Conditioned Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12402v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech language models (LMs) are promising for high-quality speech synthesis through in-context learning. A typical speech LM takes discrete semantic units as content and a short utterance as prompt, and synthesizes speech which preserves the content's semantics but mimics the prompt's style. However, there is no systematic understanding on how the synthesized audio is controlled by the prompt and content. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the widely used autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) speech LMs and provide insights into the prompt design and content semantic units. Our analysis reveals that heterogeneous and nonstationary prompts hurt the audio quality in contrast to the previous finding that longer prompts always lead to better synthesis. Moreover, we find that the speaker style of the synthesized audio is also affected by the content in addition to the prompt. We further show that semantic units carry rich acoustic information such as pitch, tempo, volume and speech emphasis, which might be leaked from the content to the synthesized audio.</p></details> | 2024-03-19 |  |
| **[Natural language guidance of high-fidelity text-to-speech with synthetic annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01912v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-speech models trained on large-scale datasets have demonstrated impressive in-context learning capabilities and naturalness. However, control of speaker identity and style in these models typically requires conditioning on reference speech recordings, limiting creative applications. Alternatively, natural language prompting of speaker identity and style has demonstrated promising results and provides an intuitive method of control. However, reliance on human-labeled descriptions prevents scaling to large datasets. Our work bridges the gap between these two approaches. We propose a scalable method for labeling various aspects of speaker identity, style, and recording conditions. We then apply this method to a 45k hour dataset, which we use to train a speech language model. Furthermore, we propose simple methods for increasing audio fidelity, significantly outperforming recent work despite relying entirely on found data. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity speech generation in a diverse range of accents, prosodic styles, channel conditions, and acoustic conditions, all accomplished with a single model and intuitive natural language conditioning.

| **[SpeechComposer: Unifying Multiple Speech Tasks with Prompt Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18045v1)** |  | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in language models have significantly enhanced performance in multiple speech-related tasks. Existing speech language models typically utilize task-dependent prompt tokens to unify various speech tasks in a single model. However, this design omits the intrinsic connections between different speech tasks, which can potentially boost the performance of each task. In this work, we propose a novel decoder-only speech language model, SpeechComposer, that can unify common speech tasks by composing a fixed set of prompt tokens. Built upon four primary tasks -- speech synthesis, speech recognition, speech language modeling, and text language modeling -- SpeechComposer can easily extend to more speech tasks via compositions of well-designed prompt tokens, like voice conversion and speech enhancement. The unification of prompt tokens also makes it possible for knowledge sharing among different speech tasks in a more structured manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SpeechComposer can improve the performance of both primary tasks and composite tasks, showing the effectiveness of the shared prompt tokens. Remarkably, the unified decoder-only model achieves a comparable and even better performance than the baselines which are expert models designed for single tasks.</p></details> | 2024-01-31 | 11 pages, 2 figures |
